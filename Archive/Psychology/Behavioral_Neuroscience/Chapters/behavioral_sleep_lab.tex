\section{What Do We Know About Sleep?}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item Sleep is an active process.
    \item Sleepiness and alertness are controlled in part by a biological clock.
    \item Things can go wrong
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item There are whole books that discuss sleep disorders.
    \end{coloredlist}
    \item \cyanit{Suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)} is the master clock of the body.
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item The SCN is located in the hypothalamus and is responsible for regulating circadian rhythms.
        \item Note the name of the SCN, it is \textit{above} the \textit{chiasm} of the optic nerve.
    \end{coloredlist}
    \item \cyanit{International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD)} -- A system for classifying sleep disorders.
    \item Three kinds of rhythms:
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item \cyanit{Ultradian} rhythms: cycles shorter than 24 hours (e.g., heart rate, respiration).
        \item \cyanit{Circadian} rhythms: cycles of about 24 hours (e.g., sleep-wake cycle, body temperature).
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item Our circadian rhythm is an endogenous clock that is influenced by exogenous factors.
            \item \cyanit{Free-running} is when the circadian rhythm is not influenced by external cues (e.g., light, temperature).
            \item It is about 24.2 hours in humans.
        \end{coloredlist}
        \item \cyanit{Infradian} rhythms: cycles longer than 24 hours (e.g., menstrual cycle, seasonal changes).
    \end{coloredlist}
    \item \cyanit{Zeitgeber} is a stimulus that helps to regulate the biological clock (e.g., light, temperature).
    \item Human clocks run long when left free running. Rats are short.
\end{coloredlist}

\section{What is Sleep?}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item For regular people, sleep is behaviorally defined as a state of reduced movement, species specific posture, reduced response to stimuli, and reversibility.
    \item For sleep researchers, they take a more physiological definition of sleep.
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item \cyanit{Polysomnography (PSG)} is a method of recording various physiological signals during sleep, including:
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item \textbf{Electroencephalography (EEG):} measures electrical activity in the brain.
            \item \textbf{Electromyogram (EMG):} measures muscle activity.
            \item \textbf{Electrooculogram (EOG):} measures eye movements.
            \item Rechtschaffen and Kales (1968) defined sleep stages based on EEG patterns.
            \item In 2007, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) updated the sleep stage criteria.

\section{Two States of Consciousness}

\subsection{Being Awake}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item Physiological definition of wakefulness:
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item Supposed to be awake for \(\frac{2}{3}^{\text{rd}}\) of the day.
        \item \(<\) 5\% of the day is spent in REM sleep.
        \item Predominantly alpha and beta waves in the brain when drowsy.
        \item Muscle activity -- high muscle tone when awake.
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item Lose muscle tone when you are sleeping.
            \begin{coloredlist}
                \item EMG is high when awake
            \end{coloredlist}
        \end{coloredlist}
        \item Variability in the eye movement
    \end{coloredlist}
\end{coloredlist}

\subsection{Being Asleep}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item Delta waves and theta waves predominantly.
    \item EMG is low
    \item Slow rolling eye movements everytime you fall asleep.
    \item \cyanit{Hypnic Jerk} -- a sudden muscle contraction that occurs when falling asleep.
    \item \cyanit{NREM Sleep} -- non-rapid eye movement sleep, which is divided into three stages:
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item \cyanit{N1} -- light sleep, theta waves, low EMG, and slow rolling eye movements (5-10\% of the night).
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item Transition between wakefulness and sleep.
            \item Hypnic jerks can occur in this stage.
            \item Muscle tone is reduced, but not completely lost.
        \end{coloredlist}
        \item \cyanit{N2} -- light sleep, theta waves, sleep spindles, K-complexes, low EMG, and slow rolling eye movements (45-55\% of the night).
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item Sleep spindles and K-complexes are characteristic of this stage.
            \item Muscle tone is further reduced compared to N1.
        \end{coloredlist}
        \item \cyanit{N3} -- deep sleep, delta waves (3-8\%), low EMG, and slow rolling eye movements (10-15\% of the night).
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item Characterized by high-amplitude delta waves.
            \item Muscle tone is at its lowest in this stage.
        \end{coloredlist}
    \end{coloredlist}
    \item \cyanit{REM Sleep} -- rapid eye movement sleep.
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item Aserinsky (1952): Discovered 70\% in infants, 20-25\% for healthy adults
        \item Characteristics:
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item EEG -- Low voltage, random, fast with sawtooth waves.
            \item Fast activity, low amplitude, and desynchronous.
            \item EMG -- atonia (loss of muscle tone).
            \item Paradoxical sleep: brain is active, but body is paralyzed.
            \item Intercostal muscles are paralyzed, but not the diaphragm (obviously).
            \item EOG -- Bursts of rapid eye movements
        \end{coloredlist}

\section{Sleep Architecture: The Hypnogram}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item \cyanit{Hypnogram} -- a graphical representation of the stages of sleep over time. (Basically a histogram of sleep stages.)
    \item Enter sleep through NREM sleep.
    \item Healthy adults trend gradually from N1 to N3, then back to N2, and then REM sleep. After \(\approx\) 90 minutes of sleep, you hit REM, and then the cycle repeats.
    \item 4-6 cycles per night.
    \item As then night progresses, the amount of time spent in N3 decreases, while the amount of time spent in REM sleep increases.
    \item The first half of the night is dominated by NREM sleep, while the second half is dominated by REM sleep.
    \item \cyanit{Voluntary Sleep Curtailment} -- when you sleep less than your body needs, you will spend more time in N3 and REM sleep to make up for the lost sleep.
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item \cyanit{REM Debt} -- the amount of REM sleep that is lost due to sleep deprivation.
        \item As a consequence of not getting enough REM, you are at risk of these conditions because REM \textbf{forces} you to get the pay your debt:
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item \cyanit{Hypnagogic Hallucinations} -- vivid, dream-like experiences that occur when falling asleep.
            \item \cyanit{Hypnopompic Hallucinations} -- vivid, dream-like experiences that occur when waking up.
            \item \cyanit{Sleep paralysis} -- a temporary inability to move or speak when waking up or falling asleep.
        \end{coloredlist}
    \end{coloredlist}
    \item Infants, people with sleeping disorders, and people with sleep deprivation all experience this sleep curtailment in one way or another.
    \item When healthy adults are sleep-deprived, their mood is worsened. However, for people with depression, their mood is improved when they are sleep-deprived. 
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item In fact, REM disruption is actually a treatment for depression.
    \end{coloredlist}
    \item \cyanit{Sleep Efficiency} -- the ratio of total sleep time to total time spent in bed.
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item Sleep researchers consider 85\% or better for sleep efficiency to be good. Anything lower is considered poor.
        \item \cyanit{Wake after sleep onset (WASO)} -- This is the amount of time spent awake after initially falling asleep.
        \item \cyanit{Sleep Latency (SL)} -- This is the amount of time it takes to fall asleep after getting into bed.
        \item Time spent in deep sleep and time it takes to get to deep sleep are both important for sleep quality.
        \item Also, time spent in REM sleep.  
        \item \cyanit{Latency to Persistent Sleep (LPS)} -- This is the amount of time it takes to fall asleep after getting into bed and staying asleep for a certain period of time (e.g., 20 minutes).
        \item \cyanit{Time Spent out of Bed (TSOB)} -- Self-explanatory.
        \item \cyanit{Total Sleep Time (TST)} -- Also self-explanatory.
    \end{coloredlist}
    \item Assign the following to either owls, larks, or neither:
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item Better on IQ tests; more likely to procrastinate; less conscientious; more open; better at baseball; more sexual partners; more likely to be unfaithful; poorer diet; smoke and drink more; more positive affect.
    \end{coloredlist}
