              Objectives. 
              The objective of the present study was to examine the cross‐sectional relation between serum 25‐hydoxyvitamin D [25‐({OH}) D] levels and depression in overweight and obese subjects and to assess the effect of vitamin D supplementation on depressive symptoms.
            
            
              Design. 
              Cross‐sectional study and randomized double blind controlled trial of 20.000 or 40.000 {IU} vitamin D per week versus placebo for 1 year.
            
            
              Setting. 
              A total of 441 subjects (body mass index 28–47 kg m
              −2
              , 159 men and 282 women, aged 21–70 years) recruited by advertisements or from the out‐patient clinic at the University Hospital of North Norway.
            
            
              Main outcome measures. 
              Beck Depression Inventory ({BDI}) score with subscales 1–13 and 14–21.
            
            
              Results. 
              Subjects with serum 25({OH})D levels {\textless}40 nmol L
              −1
              scored significantly higher (more depressive traits) than those with serum 25({OH})D levels ≥40 nmol L
              −1
              on the {BDI} total [6.0 (0–23) versus 4.5 (0–28) (median and range)] and the {BDI} subscale 1–13 [2.0 (0–15) versus 1.0 (0–29.5)] (
              P
               {\textless} 0.05). In the two groups given vitamin D, but not in the placebo group, there was a significant improvement in {BDI} scores after 1 year. There was a significant decrease in serum parathyroid hormone in the two vitamin D groups without a concomitant increase in serum calcium.
            
            
              Conclusions. 
              It appears to be a relation between serum levels of 25({OH})D and symptoms of depression. Supplementation with high doses of vitamin D seems to ameliorate these symptoms indicating a possible causal relationship.},

                To compare depressive symptoms in participants with low and high serum
                           25-hydroxyvitamin D (25({OH})D) levels and to examine whether

                3
                would improve symptoms in
                           those with low serum 25({OH})D levels.
              
            
            
              Method
              
                Participants with low 25({OH})D levels were randomised to either placebo or
                           40 000 {IU} vitamin D
                3
                per week for 6 months. Individuals with
                           high serum 25({OH})D levels were used as nested controls. Depressive
                           symptoms were evaluated with the Beck Depression Inventory, Hospital
                           Anxiety and Depression Scale, Seasonal Pattern Assessment Scale and
                           Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale. The study was registered at
                           {ClinicalTrials}.gov ({NCT}00960232).
              
            
            
              Results
              
                Participants with low 25({OH})D levels (
                n
                =230) at baseline
                           were more depressed (
                P
                {\textless}0.05) than participants with
                           high 25({OH})D levels (
                n
                =114). In the intervention study
                           no significant effect of high-dose vitamin D was found on depressive
                           symptom scores when compared with placebo.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              Low levels of serum 25({OH})D are associated with depressive symptoms, but
                           no effect was found with vitamin D supplementation.},
