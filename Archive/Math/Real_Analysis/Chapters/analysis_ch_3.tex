\section{Discussion: The Cantor Set}

We will build this set through an iterative process. Start with a number line \(C_0\) that stretches from 0 to 1. Remove the middle third of the interval, leaving two intervals of length \(\frac{1}{3}\). We will call the set of points removed from \(C_0\) \(C_1\). Next, remove the middle third of each of the two intervals, leaving four intervals of length \(\frac{1}{9}\). We will call the set of points removed from \(C_1\) \(C_2\). Continue this process indefinitely. 

% Put a tikz picture here that shows the cantor set at each step

\begin{definition}
    The \textit{Cantor set}, \(C\), is defined as \(C = \bigcap_{n=0}^\infty C_n\). This set is 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item non-empty. All end points stay within the interval.
        \item uncountable.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

The second part of that definition is a bit tricky to prove, but a visual will do for now. We can put all elements of the Cantor set in a one-to-one correspondence with the set of all 0s and 1s. This shows that not only is it uncountable, but it also has the same cardinality as \([0,1]\). % Put a tikz picture here from the notes.

The total length of removed elements, \(\frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{9} + \frac{4}{27} + \frac{8}{81} + \cdots = \frac{1}{3}(1 + \frac{2}{3} + \frac{4}{9})\). Notice the resemblance to the geometric series? We can write this as \[\frac{1}{3} \sum_{n=0}^\infty \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^n = \frac{1}{3} \left(\frac{1}{1 - \frac{2}{3}}\right) = 1.\] 

In summary, \begin{enumerate}
    \item Start with intercal \([0,1]\).
    \item Remove countably disjoint intervals.
    \item Uncountably many points between these intervals, all isolated from each other.
    \item The space taken up by the leftover points has ``length'' 0.
\end{enumerate}

When we review the properties of a fractal, we see that the Cantor set is a fractal. It is self-similar, and the dimension of the Cantor set is \(\log_3 2\).

\section{Open and closed Sets}

\begin{definition}
    For a point \(x \in \R\), and \(\epsilon > 0\), we define the \textit{epsilon-neighborhood} of \(x\) to be \(V_\epsilon(x) = \{y \in \R \mid |x - y| < \epsilon\}\).
\end{definition}

In other words, \(V_{\epsilon}(x)\) is the open interval \((x - \epsilon, x + \epsilon)\), centered at \(x\) with radius \(\epsilon\).

\subsection{Open Sets}

\begin{definition}
    A set \(A \subseteq \R\), is called an \textit{open set} if for every \(x \in A\), there exists an \(\epsilon > 0\) such that \(V_\epsilon(x) \subseteq A\).
\end{definition}

\subsubsection{Some Examples of Open Sets}

\begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item All open intervals are also open sets.
        \item \(\R\) is open.
        \item \(\emptyset\) is open.
        \item \(\{1\}\) is not open.
        \item \([0,2]\) is not open.
        \item \(\Q\) is not open.
        \item \([4,6)\) is not open.
        \item \((0,1) \cup (1,3) \cup (5,10)\) is open.
        \item \((0,3] \cap [2,4)\) is open.
        \item Cantor set is not open.
    \end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\begin{theorem}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item The union of an arbitrary collection of open sets is open.
        \item The intersection of a finite collection of open sets is open. 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\tpf{
    (i) Let \(\{O_{\lambda} \colon \lambda \in A\}\) be a collection of open sets. Then, let \(O = \bigcup_{\lambda \in A} O_{\lambda}\). Let \(a\) be an element of \(O\). To show that \(O\) is open, we need to find an \(\epsilon\)-neighborhood that is completely contained within \(O\) to satisfy \defref{3.2.1}. But \(a \in O\) implies that \(a\) is an element of at least one particular \(O_{\lambda'}\). Because we are assuming \(O_{\lambda'}\) to be open, then we can use \defref{3.2.1} to assert that there exists \(V_{\epsilon}(a) \subseteq O_{\lambda'}\). The fact that \(O_{\lambda'} \subseteq O\) confirms that \(V_{\epsilon}(a) \subseteq O\). \\

    \noindent (ii) Let \(\{O_{1},O_{2},\dots,O_{N}\}\) be a finite collection of open sets. Then, let \(a \in \bigcap_{k = 1}^{N} O_{k}\). This means \(a\) is an element of every open set. \defref{3.2.1} tells us that for \(1 \leq k \leq K\), there exists an \(V_{\epsilon}(a) \subseteq O_{k}\). From this set, we are in search of one \(\epsilon\)-neighborhood of \(a\) that is contained in every \(O_{k}\), so the trick is to pick the smallest one. Letting \(\epsilon = \min\{\epsilon_{1},\epsilon_{2},\dots,\epsilon_{N}\}\), it follows that \(V_{\epsilon}(a) \subseteq V_{\epsilon_{k}} (a)\) for all \(k\), and hence \(V_{\epsilon}(a) \subseteq \bigcap_{k = 1}^{N} O_{k}\). 
}

Note that we cannot use this for cases with infinity. For example, consider \(A_n = (-\frac{1}{n}, \frac{1}{n})\). This is open, but \(\bigcap_{n = 1}^\infty\ A_n = \{0\}\), which is not open. 

\subsection{Closed Sets}

\begin{definition}
    Let \(A \subseteq \R\). We say \(x\) is a \textit{limit point} of \(A\) if for all \(\epsilon > 0\), there exists \(a \in A\) such that \(a \in V_\epsilon(x)\) that is not \(x\). Additionally, a point \(x \in \R\) is a \textit{limit point} if, and only if, there exists a sequence \((a_n)\) of points from \(A\) that are not \(x\). And \(\limn(a_n) = x\). 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    A set \(B \subseteq \R\) is called a \textit{closed set} if \(B\) contains all its limit points. 
\end{definition}

\begin{note}
    \textbf{Important note:} Limit points could be outside a set. Consider \((0,1)\). Even though 0 and 1 do not belong to the set, they are considered limit points that are outside the set.
\end{note}

\subsubsection{Some Examples of Closed Sets}
\begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \([0,1]\) is closed.
        \item \((0,1)\) is not closed.
        \item \(\R\) is closed.
        \item \(\emptyset\) is closed.
        \item \(\Q\) is not closed.
        \item \([3, \infty)\) is closed.
        \item \(\frac{1}{n} \mid n \in \N\) not closed. (Because of 0)
        \item \([1,4] \cup \{8\}\) is closed. 
        \item \(\{1\}\) is closed. 
        \item \([1,2)\) is not closed. Note that this set is neither open or closed. 
    \end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\begin{theorem}
    A set \(B \subseteq \R\) is closed if, and only if, its complement is open. Similarly, a set \(A \subseteq \R\) is open if, and only if, its complement is closed.
\end{theorem}

\iffpf{Assume \(B \subseteq \R\) is a closed set. We will show that \(B^c\) is open. Let \(x \in B^c\). So, \(x \notin B\). This means \(x\) is not a limit point. (From the negated definition of limit point:) There must exist \(\epsilon >0\) such that no elements of \(B\) belong to \(V_\epsilon(x)\). Then, \(V_\epsilon(x) \subseteq B^c\). Therefore, \(B^c\) is open.}{Assume \(B^c\) is open. We will show that \(B\) is closed. Let \(x\) be a limit point of \(B\). For all \(\epsilon > 0\), there exists a \(b \in B\) such that \(b \subseteq V_\epsilon(x)\). So, \(V_\epsilon(x)\) is not a subset of \(B^c\). This is true for every \(\epsilon\). Since \(B^c\) is open, it must be that \(x \notin B^c\). Thus, \(x \in B\). So, \(B\) contains all its limit points. Therefore, \(B\) is closed.\qedhere}{}{xblue}

\begin{definition}
    Let \(A \subseteq \R\) and let \(L\) be the set of limit points of \(A\). The \textit{closure} of \(A\) is defined as \(\bar{A} = A \cup L\).
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item The intersection of any collection of closed sets is closed. 
        \item The union of finitely many closed sets is closed.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\tpf{
    De Morgan's Laws state that for any collection of sets \(\{E_{\lambda} \colon \lambda \in A\}\) it is true that 
    \[
    \left(\bigcup_{\lambda \in A} E_{\lambda}\right)^{c} = \bigcap_{\lambda \in A} E_{\lambda}^{c} \qquad \text{and} \qquad \left(\bigcap_{\lambda \in A} E_{\lambda}\right)^{c} = \bigcup_{\lambda \in A} E_{\lambda}^{c}. 
    \]
    The result follows directly from these statements and \numrefthm{3.2.3}.
}

\begin{theorem}
    The closure of a set is a closed set.
\end{theorem}

\textbf{Note:} This theorem may seem trivial, but it answers the question of ``Are there limit points in \(L\) that are not accounted for?''

\tpf{
    We need to show that \(\bar{A}\) contains all the limit points of \(\bar{A}\). Let \(L\) be the limit points of \(A\). Thus, \(\bar{A} = A \cup L\). Let \(x\) be a limit point of \(\bar{A}\). There exists a sequence of points \((x_n)\) coming from \(\bar{A}\) such that \((x_n) \rightarrow x\). Then, for all \(n \in \N\), either \(x_n \in A\) or \(x_n \in L\).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Case 1:} \(x_n \in A\) \\
        There exists a subsequence \((x_{n_k})\) where each \(x_{n_k} \in A\). This subsequence also converges to \(x\), and we know the limit belongs to \(L\), so \(x \in L \subseteq \bar{A}\).

        \item \textbf{Case 2:} \(x_n \in L\) \\
        \(x_n\) belongs to \(A\) for only finitely many \(n \in \N\). Thus, a tail-end of the sequence is comprised entirely of points from \(L\). To simplify things, we will assume the entire sequence \((x_n)\) comes from \(L\). (We know that \((x_n)\) converges to \(x\), but we cannot assume those limit points converge as well.) Let \(n \in \N\). Since \(x_n \in L\), there exists \(a_n \in A\) such that \(\disabs{x_n - a_n} < \frac{1}{n}\). We now have \((x_n) \rightarrow x\) and \((x_n - a_n) \rightarrow 0\). Then, \((a_n) \rightarrow x\). Thus, \(x \in L \subseteq \bar{A}\).
    \end{itemize}
    Now that we have shown that either cases leads to the same conclusion, we know that \(x \in L \subseteq \bar{A}\), and therefore \(\bar{A}\) contains all its limit points.
}

\begin{theorem}
    The closure set \(\overline{A}\) is the \textit{smallest} closed set containing \(A\). (Where ``smallest'' refers to a subset of any other closed set containing \(A\).)
\end{theorem}

\tpf{
    If \(B\) is a closed set containing \(A\), then \(A \subseteq B\) and \(L \subseteq B\). Thus, \(\bar{A} = A \cup L \subseteq B\).

    \(B_n = [\frac{1}{n}, 1 - \frac{1}{n}]\). Therefore, \(\bigcup_{n = 3}^\infty B_n = (0,1)\). For example, that would look like: \(\{\frac{1}{2}\} \cup \{\frac{1}{3}\} \cup \dots\)

%         Since \(A\) is nonempty and bounded above, \(s = \sup(A)\) exists.

%         If \(s \in A\), then \(s \in \bar{A}\) trivially.

%         Suppose \(s \notin A\). We will show that \(s\) is a limit point of \(A\), so \(s \in L \subseteq \bar{A}\).

%         By definition, \(x\) is a limit point of \(A\) if for all \(\epsilon > 0\), there exists \(a \in A\) such that \(a \in V_\epsilon(x)\) and \(a \ne x\).

%         Fix any \(\epsilon > 0\). Since \(s = \sup(A)\), for this \(\epsilon\), \(s - \epsilon\) is not an upper bound of \(A\). Therefore, there exists \(a \in A\) such that
%         \[
%         s - \epsilon < a \leq s.

%         Since \(a \leq s\) and \(a > s - \epsilon\), we have \(|a - s| < \epsilon\), so \(a \in V_\epsilon(s)\) and \(a \ne s\).

%         However, \(s\) is an upper bound of \(A\), so no element of \(A\) can be greater than \(s\).

%             Therefore, \(\overline{A} \cup \overline{B} \subseteq \overline{A \cup B}\).

%             Hence, \(\overline{A \cup B} = \overline{A} \cup \overline{B}\).

%         \item The result does not necessarily extend to infinite unions of sets.

%         Consider the sets \(A_n = \left( \frac{1}{n}, 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)\) for \(n \in \N\). Then \(\overline{A_n} = \left[ \frac{1}{n}, 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right]\).

%         The infinite union is \(A = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty A_n = (0,1)\), so \(\overline{A} = [0,1]\).

%         The union of the closures is \(\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty \overline{A_n} = (0,1)\), since none of the closed intervals \(\left[ \frac{1}{n}, 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right]\) include the endpoints 0 or 1.

%         Therefore, \(\overline{A} \ne \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty \overline{A_n}\).

\section{Compact Sets}

\begin{definition}
    A set \(K \subseteq \R\) is a \textit{compact set} if every sequence from \(K\) has a convergent subsequence where the limit is also \(K\).
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    A set \(K\) is compact if, and only if, it is closed and bounded.
\end{theorem}

\iffpf{Assume a set \(A \subseteq \R\) is closed and bounded. Thus, there exists a convergent subsequence by \namrefthm{Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem}. Because \(A\) is closed, the limit is in the set by \defref{3.2.5}.}{Assume a set \(A\) is compact. If it is not bounded, then there exists an \((a_n)\) that heads toward infinity. This contradicts \defref{3.3.1}, so it must be bounded. Then, by the same definition, the limit points belong in the set, so it is closed.\qedhere}{}{xblue}

\begin{definition}
    Let \(A \in \R\). An \textit{open cover} for \(A\) is a collection of open sets \(\{O_\lambda \mid \lambda \in A\}\) whose union contains the set \(A\); that is \(A \subseteq \bigcup_{\lambda \in A}O_\lambda\). Given an open cover for \(A\), a \textit{finite subcover} is a finite sub-collection of open sets from the original open cover whose union still manages to completely contain \(A\).
\end{definition}

\begin{ntheorem}
    {Heine-Borel Theorem}Let \(K\) be a  subset of  \(\R\). All the following statements are equivalent in the sense that any of them implies the two others: 
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item \(K\) is compact.
        \item \(K\) is closed and bounded.
        \item Every open cover of \(K\) has a finite subcover.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{ntheorem}

\tpf{ The first set of ``if and only if proofs'' will be to prove (i) and (ii) are equivalent. Then, we will prove (ii) and (iii) are equivalent. 
    \begin{customframedproof}[linecolor=xgray]
        \begin{proofpart}[xgray]{(\(\Rightarrow\))}
            Assume \(K\) is compact. We need to show that \(K\) is closed and bounded. To show \(K\) is bounded, consider the open cover \(\mathcal{U} = \{(-n, n) \mid n \in \N\}\). \(\mathcal{U}\) covers all of \(\R\), so it certainly covers \(K\). Thus, there must exist a finite subcover. Consider the longest interval in the subcover. Then, \(K\) is a subset of this interval, so \(K\) is bounded. To show \(K\) is closed, we need to show every limit point belongs to \(K\). Assume \(x\) is a limit point of \(K\). From \defref{3.2.4} for every \(a \in K\), let \(\epsilon_a = \frac{1}{2}\disabs{a - x}\). Consider the open cover \(\mathcal{U} = \{V_{\epsilon_a}(a) \mid a \in K\} \). This covers every point on \(K\).
        \end{proofpart}
    \vspace{2mm}
            \begin{proofpart}[xgray]{(\(\Leftarrow\))}
                Because it is closed and bounded, by \numrefthm{3.3.2}, \(K\) is compact.
            \end{proofpart}
    \vspace{2mm}
    \end{customframedproof}
    \vspace{0.5cm}
    Now for the second part of the proof:

    \begin{customframedproof}[linecolor=xgray]
        \begin{proofpart}[xgray]{(\(\Rightarrow\))}
            Let \(x\) be a limit point of \(K\). This means there must exist a sequence \((x_n)\) in \(K\) with \(\limn x_n = x\). Suppose \(x \notin K\). For every \(y \in K\). Let \(\epsilon_y = \frac{1}{2}\disabs{y-x}\). Consider the open neighborhood \(V_{\epsilon_y}(y)\). Notice \(x \in V_{\epsilon_y} (y)\). Now, we will work with the collection of all such neighborhoods \(\mathcal{U} = \{V_{\epsilon_y}(y) \mid y \in K\}\). This \(\mathcal{U}\) is an open cover of \(K\). By our hypothesis there exists a finite subcover. There are some \(y_1,y_2,\dots,y_m\) such that \(K \subset \bigcup_{i = 1}^m V_{\epsilon_y}(y_i)\). Look at the distance from \(x\) to each \(y_i\): \((x - \epsilon_{y_i}\text{, } x + \epsilon_{y_i}) \cap V_{\epsilon_{y_i}} (y_i) = \emptyset\). Similar statements are for every \(y_i\). Let \(\epsilon = \min\{\epsilon_{y_1}, \epsilon_{y_2},\dots \epsilon_{y_M}\}\). Since there are infinitely many \(\epsilon > 0\), we see that \(V_\epsilon(x)\cap V_{\epsilon_y}(y_i) = \emptyset\) for every \(i \leq M\). So \(V_\epsilon (x) \cap K = \emptyset\). This gives us an \(\epsilon\)-neighborhood around \(x\) that does not intersect \(K\). Since \((x_n)\) approaches \(x\), there must be elements from the sequence that are inside of \(V_\epsilon(x)\). This creates a contradiction because we said \(x\) was a limit point. Therefore \(x \in u\) and \(K\) must be closed.
        \end{proofpart}
    \vspace{2mm}
            \begin{proofpart}[xgray]{(\(\Leftarrow\))}
                Let \(\mathcal{U}\) be an open cover of \(K\). Suppose there is no finite subcover. Since \(K\) is bounded there exists a closed interval \(I_0\) that contains \(K\). Bisect \(I_0\) and look at the two sub intervals \(A\) and \(B\). My claim is at least one of \(A \cap K\) and \(B \cap K\) does not have a finite subcover from \(\mathcal{U}\). If not, then we would have a finite subcover of all of K. Whichever half does not have a finites of cover will be called \(I_1\). Repeat this process. We get a sequence of nested closed intervals \(I_0 \supseteq I_1 \supseteq I_2 \supseteq \cdots\) such that for all \(j \in \N\), \(I_j \cap K\) does not have a finite subcover from \(\mathcal{U}\). Also, as the length of \(I_j\) approach 0, by the \namrefthm{Nested Interval Property}, there exists \(x \in \bigcap_{j = 1}^{\infty} I_j\). Since each \(I_j\) contains an element of \(K\) and the interval approaches 0, \(x\) must be a limit point of \(K\). Thus, since \(K\) is closed, \(x \in K\). There must be an open set \(U \in \mathcal{U}\) such that \(x \in U\). Since \(U\) is open and \(x \in U\), there exists an \(\epsilon > 0\) such that \(V_\epsilon(x) \subseteq U\). There is an \(I_j\) whose length is smaller than \(\epsilon\). This means \(I_j \subseteq V_\epsilon \subset U\). So \(\{U\}\) is a finite subcover of \(I_j \cap K\). This contradicts how we defined \(I_j\), therefore there must be a finite subcover from \(\mathcal{U}\). \qedhere

    Consider \(\mathcal{U} = \{(0,t) \mid 0 < t < 1\}\). Thus, \(\mathcal{U}\) is an open cover, but does not contain a finite amount of subcovers because there will always be a point not covered.

% \begin{exercise}
%     {3.3.4}Assume \(K\) is \hyperref[def:3.3.1]{compact} and \(F\) is \hyperref[def:3.2.5]{closed}. Decide if the following sets are definitely compact, definitely closed, both, or neither. 
%     \begin{enumerate}
%         \item \(K \cap F\)
%         \item \(\overline{F^c \cup K^c}\)
%         \item \(K \setminus F = \{x \in K \mid x \notin F\}\)
%         \item \(\overline{K \cap F^c}\)
%     \end{enumerate}
% \end{exercise}

% \sol{
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Since \(K\) and \(F\) are closed, their intersection \(K \cap F\) is closed (\numrefthm{3.2.8}).

%     To show that \(K \cap F\) is compact, let \(\mathcal{U}\) be any open cover of \(K \cap F\). Our goal is to extract a finite subcover from \(\mathcal{U}\). We can then use the \namrefthm{Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem} (iii) to show that \(K \cap F\) is compact.

%     Since \(F\) is closed, its complement \(F^c\) is open (\numrefthm{3.2.6}). Then \(K \setminus F = K \cap F^c\) is open as the intersection of an open set and \(K\).

%     Consider the open cover \(\mathcal{U}' = \mathcal{U} \cup \{K \setminus F\}\) of \(K\). Every point in \(K\) is either in \(K \cap F\) (covered by \(\mathcal{U}\)) or in \(K \setminus F\) (covered by \(K \setminus F\)).

%     Since \(K\) is compact, there exists a finite subcover \(\mathcal{U}'' \subseteq \mathcal{U}'\) that covers \(K\).

%     If \(K \setminus F\) is in \(\mathcal{U}''\), remove it to obtain a finite subcollection of \(\mathcal{U}\) that still covers \(K \cap F\). If \(K \setminus F\) is not in \(\mathcal{U}''\), then \(\mathcal{U}'' \subseteq \mathcal{U}\) already covers \(K \cap F\).

%     Therefore, \(K \cap F\) is compact.

%     \textbf{Conclusion:} Both compact and closed.

%     \item Since \(F\) and \(K\) are closed, \(F^c\) and \(K^c\) are open. The union \(F^c \cup K^c\) is open (\numrefthm{3.2.3}), so its closure \(\overline{F^c \cup K^c}\) is closed by \numrefthm{3.2.9}.

%     This set may not be bounded, so it's not necessarily compact.

%     \textbf{Conclusion:} Definitely closed.

%     \item The set \(K \setminus F = K \cap F^c\) is the intersection of a compact set \(K\) and an open set \(F^c\). This set is open in \(K\) but not necessarily open or closed in \(\mathbb{R}\).

%     Since \(K \setminus F\) is not necessarily closed, it may not be compact.

%     \textbf{Conclusion:} Neither compact nor closed.

%     \item The set \(K \cap F^c\) is open in \(K\), so its closure \(\overline{K \cap F^c}\) is closed by \numrefthm{3.2.9}.

%     To show that \(\overline{K \cap F^c}\) is compact, let \(\mathcal{U}\) be any open cover of \(\overline{K \cap F^c}\).

%     Since \(\overline{K \cap F^c} \subseteq K\) and \(K\) is compact, we can consider \(\mathcal{U}\) as an open cover of a subset of \(K\).

%     By the definition of \hyperref[def:3.3.3]{open cover}, there exists a finite subcover of \(\mathcal{U}\) that covers \(\overline{K \cap F^c}\).

%     Therefore, \(\overline{K \cap F^c}\) is compact.

%     \textbf{Conclusion:} Both compact and closed.

%         \item \(\overline{A \cup B}\)

%         The closure of any set is closed by definition. Therefore, \(\overline{A \cup B}\) is definitely closed.

%         \textbf{Conclusion: Closed.}

%         \item \(A \setminus B = \{x \in A \mid x \notin B\}\)

%         Since \(B\) is closed, its complement \(B^c\) is open. Since \(A\) is open, the intersection \(A \cap B^c = A \setminus B\) is the intersection of two open sets, which is open.

%         \textbf{Conclusion: Open.}

%         \item \((A^c \cup B)^c\)

%         Applying De Morgan's Law:
%         \[
%         (A^c \cup B)^c = A \cap B^c
%         \]
%         Since \(A\) is open and \(B^c\) is open (because \(B\) is closed), their intersection \(A \cap B^c\) is open.

%         \textbf{Conclusion: Open.}

%         \item \((A \cap B) \cup (A^c \cap B)\)

%         Simplify the expression:

%         \]
%         Thus, the set equals \(B\), which is closed.

%         \textbf{Conclusion: Closed.}

%         \item \(\overline{A}^c \cap \overline{A^c}\)

%         Since \(A\) is open, its closure \(\overline{A}\) is closed, so \(\overline{A}^c\) is open.

%         Since \(A^c\) is closed (being the complement of an open set), \(\overline{A^c} = A^c\) is closed.

%         Therefore, \(\overline{A}^c \cap \overline{A^c}\) is the intersection of an open set and a closed set, which is generally open but not necessarily closed.

%         For example, let \(A = (0,1)\). Then:
%         \[
%         \overline{A} = [0,1], \quad \overline{A}^c = (-\infty, 0) \cup (1,\infty)
%         \]
%         and
%         \[
%         \overline{A^c} = A^c = (-\infty, 0] \cup [1,\infty)
%         \]
%         Then:
%         \[
%         \overline{A}^c \cap \overline{A^c} = [(-\infty, 0) \cup (1,\infty)] \cap [(-\infty, 0] \cup [1,\infty)] = (-\infty, 0) \cup (1,\infty)
%         \]
%         Which is an open set.
