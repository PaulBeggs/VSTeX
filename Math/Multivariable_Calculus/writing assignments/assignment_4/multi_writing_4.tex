% Problem. We saw previously in class the second derivative test for determining whether a critical point of the scalar
% function f(x, y) is a local maximum, local minimum, or neither. This assignment will explain why the test looks like
% it does. We will accomplish this by the following:
%  Show that the second derivative test works in the particular case when the function is a quadratic, with critical
% point at the origin
%  For a given function f, build a new function g which shifts it critical point to the origin.
%  Make connection back to Taylor Polynomials from Calculus II to generate, for any twice-differentiable scalar
% function, the second-order Taylor polynomial at a critical point
%  Show that the Taylor Polynomial behaves according to the second derivative test – and argue that its “parent”
% function must do so as well.
% 1. Consider the paraboloid q(x, y) = ax2 + bxy + cy2, where we will assume that a, c ̸= 0. We will investigate the
% behavior of q at its critical point.
% (a) Assume that b2 − 4ac ̸= 0. Show that (0, 0) is the only critical point.
% (b) By completing the square, show that
% q(x, y) = a

% .
% (c) Suppose that D = 4ac − b2. Without using the second derivative test:
% i. Suppose that D > 0 and a > 0. Show that q has a local minimum at (0, 0). [Hint: Show that
% q(0, 0) = 0. Use the fact that a and D are both positive to conclude that when x, y ̸= 0, q(x, y) > 0.]
% ii. Suppose that D > 0 and a < 0. Show that q has a local maximum at (0, 0).
% iii. Finally, suppose that D < 0. Show that q has a saddle point. [Hint: Explain why the tangent plane
% at (0, 0) has equation z = 0. We wish to show that q crosses this tangent plane, by showing there
% exist different paths for which q has opposite signs along those paths. I am happy to help here, but
% please do not wait until two hours before this is due!]
% (d) Point out that the value D as described above is exactly the function D(x, y) involved in the second
% derivative test, and that the results match that test for the particular function q.
% [The above takes care of the first bullet point – shows that the second derivative test works in the special case
% of a quadratic, with critical point at the origin.]
% 2. Suppose that f(x, y) is any continuous function of two variables such that each of the first and second order
% partial derivatives are also continuous at the point (x0, y0).
% (a) Suppose that (x0, y0) is a critical point of f and let g(x, y) = f(x + x0, y + y0) − f(x0, y0). [This just
% makes g a “shift” of f.] Show:
% i. g(0, 0) = 0
% ii. gx(0, 0) = 0 = gy(0, 0), so that g has a critical point at (0, 0) and has value 0 at (0, 0) as well.
% iii. Show that the three second-order partial derivatives of g, evaluated at (0, 0) give the same answer as
% the second partials of f, evaluated at (x0, y0).
% (b) Explain why the behavior of f at (x0, y0) is the same as the behavior of g at (0, 0) – that is, both have
% a local minimum, both have a local maximum, or both have a saddle point. [Hint: Remember that g is
% really just a shift of f.]
% [This allows us to shift any general function f to a new function g with a critical point at the origin – though,
% unfortunately, there is no guarantee that g is quadratic.]
% 3. For the function g(x, y), build the quadratic polynomial Q(x, y), defined by
% Q(x, y) = g(0, 0) + gx(0, 0)x + gy(0, 0)y +
% 1
% 2
% gxx(0, 0)x2 + gxy(0, 0)xy +

% =
% 1
% 2
% gxx(0, 0)x2 + gxy(0, 0)xy +
% 1
% 2
% gyy(0, 0)y2,
% since for g, the value of the function and both first-order partials vanish at (0, 0).
% (a) Show that g and Q have the same values, same first derivatives, and same second derivatives at the point
% (0, 0) – and note that (0, 0) is a critical point for Q as well as g.
% (b) Briefly explain – maybe using the Calculus II idea of a Taylor polynomial? – why we might expect that
% g(x, y) ≈ Q(x, y) for (x, y) ≈ (0, 0).
% (c) Then, explain why if the critical point is a local maximum for Q, it should be for g, if it is a local minimum
% for Q, it should be for g, and so on.
% (d) Notice that Q(x, y) = ax2 + bxy + cy2 – where you should find values for a, b, c in terms of second-order
% partial derivatives of g.
% (e) What does part 1 say about when Q has a max, a min, or neither?
% (f) Turn this into an equivalent statement about when g has a max, min, or neither.
% 4. Finally, summarize the result of this problem, as it relates to classifying the critical point (x0, y0) for f.

% --- Hints ---

% For #1c(iii) – you need to find a pair of paths that leads to values of q(x,y) with different signs. Try: y = 0 (so that only x changes) and x = -b/(2a) y.
% The first path, except at (0,0) takes on the sign of a – since the (4ac-b)^2/(4a^2)y^2 term is zero, due to y = 0.
% On the second path, since D = 4ac-b^2 < 0, we know that, except again at (0,0), we have a negative inside the square brackets, and so we get the opposite of the sign of a
% Thus, we have two paths, one of which looks like a U shaped curve and one like an upside down U. This makes (0,0) a saddle.
 
% For #2: Remember that while x and y are variables, x_0 and y_0 are not! They are constant
% For 2a(ii):  g_x(x,y) = f_x(x+x_0,y+y_0) and similarly for g_y For iii, just be really careful as you take each partial making sure you know which thing is the variable at which time.
 
% For #3:
% a. Again, just take derivatives, making sure you know what is a variable and what is constant.
% For the rest, just think about Taylor Polys:  For a function of one variable, its second order Taylor poly, at x = 0, is just f(0) + f ‘ (0)*x + ½ * f ‘’ (0) x^2.  This is all that is happening here, except we make every possible first and every possible second order derivative.

\section{Introduction}

In this paper, our goal is to analyze the second derivative test for functions of two variables. We will start with a quadratic function and show that the second derivative test works in this case. Then, we will generalize this to any twice-differentiable scalar function using Taylor polynomials. Finally, we will summarize the results and their implications for classifying critical points.

\section{Investigating the Quadratic Function}

Let's start by looking at a quadratic function of the form \( q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2 \), where we assume that \( a, c \neq 0 \) and \(b^{2} - 4ac \ne 0\). We want to look into how \( q \) behaves at its critical point. Remember that a critical point for a function of two variables can be found by finding the points where the gradient is zero. Thus, to find the critical points, we need to find the partial derivatives of \( q \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \) and set them equal to zero:
\[
    \frac{\partial q}{\partial x} = 2ax + by = 0, \quad \frac{\partial q}{\partial y} = bx + 2cy = 0.
\]
This leaves us with the system of equations:
\begin{align*}
    2ax + by &= 0 \\
    bx + 2cy &= 0
\end{align*}
We can rewrite the first equation as \( y = -\frac{2a}{b}x \) and substitute this into the second equation to get:
\[
    bx + 2c\left(-\frac{2a}{b}x\right) = 0 \implies \left(b - \frac{4ac}{b}\right)x = 0.
\]
This gives us two cases: either \( x = 0 \) or \( b - \frac{4ac}{b} = 0 \). If \( x = 0 \), then substituting back into the first equation gives us \( y = 0 \). Thus, we have one critical point at \( (0, 0) \). If \( b - \frac{4ac}{b} = 0 \), then we have \( b^2 - 4ac = 0 \), which is not allowed by our assumption. Therefore, the only critical point is at \( (0, 0) \). \\

Now that we've identified the critical point, our next step is to understand the nature of this point – specifically, whether it corresponds to a local minimum, local maximum, or a saddle point. To analyze the function's behavior, particularly its sign, around this critical point, we will rewrite the expression for \( q(x, y) \) by completing the square with respect to the \(x\) terms and treating \(y\) as a constant:
\begin{align*}
    q(x, y) &= ax^2 + bxy + cy^2 \\
    \intertext{Factor out \(a\) from the terms involving \(x\):}
    &= a\left(x^2 + \frac{b}{a}xy\right) + cy^2 \\
    \intertext{Now, we need to complete the square for the expression in parentheses. Remember that we need to calculate \((\frac{b}{2})^{2}\) for our function of the form \(ax^{2} + bx + c = 0\).} 
    &= a
\end{align*}


\begin{align*}
    q(x, y) &= ax^2 + bxy + cy^2 \\
    &= a\left(x^2 + \frac{b}{a}xy + \frac{c}{a}y^2\right) \\
    &= a\left(x^2 + \frac{b}{a}xy + \frac{b^2}{4a^2}y^2 - \frac{b^2}{4a^2}y^2 + \frac{c}{a}y^2\right) \\
    &= a\left(\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}y\right)^2 - \frac{b^2 - 4ac}{4a^2}y^2\right).
\end{align*}
This shows that we can express \( q(x, y) \) in the form:
\begin{align*}
    q(x, y) &= a\left(\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}y\right)^2 + \frac{4ac - b^2}{4a^2}y^2\right) \\
    &= a\left(\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}y\right)^2 + \frac{D}{4a^2}y^2\right),
\end{align*}
where \( D = 4ac - b^2 \). This expression allows us to analyze the behavior of \( q(x, y) \) at the critical point \( (0, 0) \).
