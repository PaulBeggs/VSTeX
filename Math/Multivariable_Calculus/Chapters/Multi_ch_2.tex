\section{Vectors in the Plane}

\subsection{Notation}

In print, we write vectors in bold like: $\mathbf{v}$, $\mathbf{w}$, $\mathbf{u}$, \dots.  In handwriting, we often write vectors with an arrow over the top: $\vec{v}$, $\vec{w}$, $\vec{u}$, \dots.

\subsection{Vectors}

A \cyanit{vector} is a quantity with both \cyanit{magnitude} (size, length, strength, \dots) and \cyanit{direction}.  

Given two points in the plane \(P = (x_{1},y_{1})\) and \(Q = (x_{2},y_{2})\), the vector from \(P\) to \(Q\), denoted \(\overrightarrow{PQ} = \mathbf{PQ} = \langle x_{2}-x_{1},y_{2}-y_{1}\rangle\). \\

We can also simply state components (known as \cyanit{component form}): \(\mathbf{v} = \langle x, y\rangle\). \\

The \cyanit{zero vector}, denoted \(\mathbf{0}\), is \(\mathbf{0} = \langle 0,0 \rangle\). Note that \(\mathbf{0} \ne 0\). \\

A \cyanit{scalar} is a real number (or a magnitude), without direction. \\

If \(c\) is a scalar and \(\mathbf{v} = \langle x,y\rangle\), then
\[
    c\mathbf{v} = c\langle x,y\rangle = \langle cx,cy\rangle.
\]
This operation is called \cyanit{scalar multiplication}. Scalar multiplication changes the magnitude of a vector, but not its direction. \\

Note that the individual components of a vector are themselves \cyanit{scalars}. You need to keep track of which is which. \\

If \(\mathbf{v} = \langle x_{1},y_{1} \rangle\) and \(\mathbf{w} = \brackett{x_{2},y_{2}}\), then the \cyanit{vector sum} 
\[
    \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w} = \langle x_{1}+x_{2},y_{1}+y_{2}\rangle.
\] 
That is, we add component wise. \\

If \(\mathbf{v} = \langle x_{1},y_{1} \rangle\), then the \cyanit{magnitude} of \(\mathbf{v}\) is given by
\[
    \norm{v} = \sqrt{x_{1}^{2}+y_{1}^{2}}.
\]
This is really just the Pythagorean theorem. \\

\section{Vectors in Space}

In \(\R^{3}\), we have three axes, \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\), which follow the \cyanit{right-hand rule}: point the fingers of the right hand in the direction of the positive \(x\)-axis, curl them towards the positive \(y\)-axis, and the thumb points in the direction of the positive \(z\)-axis. \\

Since the distance formula in \(\R^{3}\) is \(d = \sqrt{(x_{2} - x_{1})^{2} + (y_{2} - y_{1})^{2} + (z_{2} - z_{1})^{2}}\), then \(\mathbf{u} = \brackett{x,y,z}\) we have \(\norm{u} = \sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2}}\). \\

To \cyanit{normalize} a vector, we divide by its magnitude: \(\mathbf{v} = \brackett{x,y,z}\), then \(\mathbf{u} = \frac{1}{\norm{v}}\mathbf{v} = \brackett{\frac{x}{\norm{v}},\frac{y}{\norm{v}},\frac{z}{\norm{v}}}\). This gives us a \cyanit{unit vector} in the direction of \(\mathbf{v}\). \\

Everything else is basically the same.

\subsection{Vector Properties}

Suppose that each of \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\) are vectors and \(r\) and \(s\) are scalars. Then the following properties hold:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \cyanit{Additive Commutativity}: \(\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v}\).
    \item \cyanit{Additive Associativity}: \(\mathbf{u} + (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = (\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) + \mathbf{w}\).
    \item \cyanit{Additive Identity}: \(\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{0} = \mathbf{v}\).
    \item \cyanit{Additive Inverse}: \(-\mathbf{v} = (-1)\mathbf{v}\) and \(\mathbf{v} + (-\mathbf{v}) = \mathbf{0}\).
    \item \cyanit{Scalar Associativity}: \(r(s\mathbf{u})= (rs)\mathbf{u}\).
    \item \cyanit{Scalars Distributive over Vectors}: \(r(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) = r\mathbf{u} + r\mathbf{v}\).
    \item \cyanit{Vectors Distributive over Scalars}: \((r+s)\mathbf{u} = r\mathbf{u} + s\mathbf{u}\).
    \item \cyanit{Multiplicative Identity}: \(1\mathbf{u} = \mathbf{u}\).
    \item \cyanit{Zero Scalar}: \(0\mathbf{u} = \mathbf{0}\).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Special Vectors}

A \cyanit{unit vector} is a vector \(\mathbf{u}\) such that \(\norm{u} = 1\). \\

In \(\R^{2}\) the \cyanit{standard unit vectors} are \(\hat{\imath} = \mathbf{i} = \brackett{1,0}\) and \(\hat{\jmath} = \mathbf{j} = \brackett{0,1}\). This allows us to write \(\mathbf{v} = \brackett{2,3} = 2\mathbf{i} + 3\mathbf{j}\), for example. \\

In \(\R^{3}\), we have three stand unit vectors, \(\hat{\imath} = \mathbf{i} = \brackett{1,0,0}\), \(\hat{\jmath} = \mathbf{j} = \brackett{0,1,0}\), and \(\hat{k} = \mathbf{k} = \brackett{0,0,1}\).  \\

It is a picky detail, but \(\mathbf{i} \in \R^{2} \ne \mathbf{i} \in \R^{3}\). 

\section{The Dot Product}

Suppose \(\mathbf{u} = \brackett{u_{1},u_{2},\dots u_{n}}\) and \(\mathbf{v} = \brackett{v_{1},v_{2},\dots v_{n}}\) are vectors in \(\R^{n}\). Then the \cyanit{dot product} of \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\) is given by
\[
    \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = u_{1}v_{1} + u_{2}v_{2} + \cdots + u_{n}v_{n}.
\]
That is, we multiply the corresponding components and sum the results. \\

It should be clear that \(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}\) results in a scalar. The dot product is a special type of inner product. \\

Think of the dot product as a way to measure how much of one vector points in the same direction as another.

\subsection{Properties of the Dot Product}

Let \(\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w} \in \R^{n}\) and \(c\) be a scalar. Then the following properties hold:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \cyanit{Commutativity}: \(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u}\).
    \item \cyanit{Distributive Property}: \(\mathbf{u} \cdot (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{w}\).
    \item \cyanit{Scalar Associativity}: \((c\mathbf{u}) \cdot \mathbf{v} = c(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}) = \mathbf{u} \cdot (c\mathbf{v})\).
    \item \cyanit{Self-Product}: \(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u} = \norm{u}^{2}\).
    \item \cyanit{Magnitude}: \(\norm{v} = \mysqrt{v} \cdot v\)
    \item \cyanit{Angle}: \(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \norm{u}\norm{v}\cos(\theta)\), where \(0 \leq \theta \leq \pi\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\). (Law of Cosines.)
    \item \cyanit{Orthogonality}: \(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0\) if and only if \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\) are orthogonal.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Projections}

The \cyanit{projection} of \(\mathbf{u}\) onto \(\mathbf{v}\) is given by
\[
    \text{proj}_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{u} = \left(\frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}}{\norm{v}^{2}}\right)\mathbf{v}.
\]
This is a vector parallel to \(\mathbf{v}\), which has length equal to the amount of \(\mathbf{u}\) which points in the same direction as \(\mathbf{v}\). \\

Think of a projection as a measure of how much of one vector points in the same direction as another. 

\subsection{Work}

If a constant force \(\mathbf{F}\) moved an object from \(P\) to \(Q\), the \cyanit{work} done is given by
\[
    W = \mathbf{F} \cdot \overrightarrow{PQ}.
\]
Thus, if that force acts at an angle \(\theta\) to the line of motion, the work is:
\[
    W = (\norm{F})\norm{PQ}\cos(\theta).
\]
Later this semester, we will learn how to compensate for a non-constant force, and over a non-linear path.

\section{The Cross Product}

Suppose that \(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v} \in \R^{3}\). Then, the \cyanit{cross product} of \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\), denoted by \(\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}\), is the unique right-hand rule vector orthogonal to each of \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(v\) whose magnitude is equal to the area of the parallelogram spanned by \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\). \\

Let \(\mathbf{u} = \brackett{u_{1},u_{2},u_{3}}\) and \(\mathbf{v} = \brackett{v_{1},v_{2},v_{3}}\). Then,
\[
    \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = \brackett{u_{2}v_{3} - u_{3}v_{2}, \ u_{3}v_{1} - u_{1}v_{3}, \ u_{1}v_{2} - u_{2}v_{1}}.
\]

\begin{center}
    \textsc{Note:} You will never multiply an \(v_{1}\)-coordinate by an \(u_{1}\)-coordinate. This is true for all \(v_{n}\) and \(u_{n}\) coordinates.
\end{center}

You can show by working the algebra that \(\mathbf{u} \cdot (\mb{u} \times \mb{v}) = 0 \) and \(\mb{v} \cdot (\mb{u} \times \mb{v}) = 0\). \\

With determinants, you can do this in one step:
\[
    \mb{u} \times \mb{v} = \begin{vmatrix}
        \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
        u_{1} & u_{2} & u_{3} \\
        v_{1} & v_{2} & v_{3}
    \end{vmatrix}
\]
Oddly, we can only define a cross-product in \(\R\), \(\R^{3}\), and \(\R^{7}\), while the dot product is \textit{always} defined.

\subsubsection{Example}

\begin{align*}
    \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} &= \brackett{2,1,4} \cdot \brackett{1,-3,1} \\
    &= \brackett{(1)(1) - 4(-3), 4(1) - 2(1), 2(-3) - 1(1)} \\
    &= \brackett{13,2,-7}.
\end{align*}

\subsection{Properties of the Cross Product}

Let \(\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w} \in \R^{3}\) and \(c\) be a scalar. Then the following properties hold:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \cyanit{Anticommutativity}: \(\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = -\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{u}\).
    \item \cyanit{Distributive Property}: \(\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}\).
    \item \cyanit{Scalar Associativity}: \((c\mathbf{u}) \times \mathbf{v} = c(\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}) = \mathbf{u} \times (c\mathbf{v})\).
    \item \cyanit{Zero}: \(\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{u} = \mathbf{0}\).
    \item \cyanit{Nilpotence}: \(\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0}\) if and only if \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\) are parallel.
    \item \cyanit{Scalar Triple Product}: \(\mb{u} \cdot (\mb{v} \times \mb{w}) = (\mb{u} \times \mb{v}) \cdot \mb{w}\).
    \item \cyanit{Angle}: \(\norm{u \times v} = \norm{u}\norm{v}\sin(\theta)\), where \(0 \leq \theta \leq \pi\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Standard Unit Vectors and the Cross Product}

\(\mb{i} \times \mb{i} = \mb{j} \times \mb{j} = \mb{k} \times \mb{k} = \mb{0}\).
\begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \(\mb{i} \times \mb{j} = \mb{k}\) 
        \item \(\mb{j} \times \mb{i} = -\mb{k}\)
        \item \(\mb{j} \times \mb{k} = \mb{i}\) 
        \item \(\mb{k} \times \mb{j} = -\mb{i}\)
        \item \(\mb{k} \times \mb{i} = \mb{j}\) 
        \item \(\mb{i} \times \mb{k} = -\mb{j}\)
    \end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\subsection{Torque}

\cyanit{Torque}, denoted by \(\mb{\tau}\), measures the tendency to produce a rotation about an axis. \\

If \(\mb{r}\) is a radial vector from an axis to a force and \(\mb{F}\) is the force, then the torque induced on the axis by the force is given by:
\[
    \mb{\tau} = \mb{r} \times \mb{F} \qquad \text{or} \qquad \norm{\mb{\tau}} = \norm{r}\norm{F}\sin(\theta),
\]
