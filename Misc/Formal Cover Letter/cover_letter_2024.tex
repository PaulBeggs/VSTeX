% Opening
Dear Ms. McCarty,

% Introduction paragraph
% Explcitly state the position you are applying for. Explain why you are applying and then give a brief overview of what you will be discussing in the body of the letter.

I am writing to apply for the internship opportunity at Conway Behavioral Health Hospital. I have personal experience with rehabilitation which, in combination with my behavioral health and suicide intervention training, will allow me to effectively contribute to Conway Behavioral Health Hospital's mission of empowering patients to take active control of their recovery. Furthermore, Conway Behavioral Health Hospital's patient-centered care---rather than symptom-centered care---is, in my opinion, the most effective treatment for adverse behavioral health afflictions.

Ever since I went to my first therapy session 5 years ago, where I was introduced to the field of counseling and psychology, I knew counseling was something I was going to do for the rest of my life. What started as a means for helping myself, soon turned into an overwhelming passion to further this practice so more people could be reached. I looked outward for volunteering institutions, so I could help where I could. Eventually, I found the Rape, Incest, and Abuse National Network (RAINN) hotline. I fostered my capacity to empathize, learn, and apply the skill set that I had already been cultivating for years before I started training.
