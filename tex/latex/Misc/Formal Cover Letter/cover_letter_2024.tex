% Opening
Dear Ms. McCarty,

I am writing to apply for the internship opportunity at the Adult Psychiatric Unit at Conway Regional Health System. My background in behavioral health and suicide intervention training, combined with personal experience in rehabilitation, positions me to effectively support the unit's mission of fostering hope, understanding, and guiding patients toward recovery. Furthermore, I deeply admire the Adult Psychiatric Unit's emphasis on patient-centered care, which I believe is essential for fostering lasting recovery in individuals facing behavioral health challenges.

% Body

Ever since I was introduced to therapeutic methods five years ago, I knew counseling was my calling. What began as a personal journey of helping myself, soon evolved into a deep passion for expanding access to support and care for others. To contribute meaningfully, I sought out volunteering opportunities and found the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network (RAINN) hotline. Through this experience, I honed my empathy, active listening, and intervention skills, building on a foundation I had been cultivating for years. These abilities align closely with the mission of the Adult Psychiatric Unit, and I am eager to bring them to your team.

In August, I underwent training to become a Student Outreach Additional Resources (SOAR) Mentor at Hendrix College. This intensive program taught me how to identify signs of emotional distress, intervene appropriately, and collaborate with individuals to develop personalized safety plans. This experience not only deepened my understanding of crisis intervention but also reinforced my commitment to providing empathetic, patient-focused support. My ability to communicate with compassion, paired with my training in structured crisis response, equips me to contribute meaningfully to the Adult Psychiatric Unitâ€™s mission of fostering hope and recovery.

% Closing

In addition to my training and experiences in behavioral health, my passion for helping others makes me confident that I would be a valuable addition to the Adult Psychiatric Unit. I am eager to contribute to your team's impactful work and would welcome the opportunity to discuss my application further. Thank you for considering my application, and I hope to hear from you soon.


Sincerely, \\
