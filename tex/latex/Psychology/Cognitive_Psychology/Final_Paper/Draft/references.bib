  abstract     = {Abstract
                  
                  Post-traumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}) presents a major public health problem for which currently available treatments are modestly effective. We report the findings of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-site phase 3 clinical trial ({NCT}03537014) to test the efficacy and safety of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine ({MDMA})-assisted therapy for the treatment of patients with severe {PTSD}, including those with common comorbidities such as dissociation, depression, a history of alcohol and substance use disorders, and childhood trauma. After psychiatric medication washout, participants (
                  n
                  = 90) were randomized 1:1 to receive manualized therapy with {MDMA} or with placebo, combined with three preparatory and nine integrative therapy sessions. {PTSD} symptoms, measured with the Clinician-Administered {PTSD} Scale for {DSM}-5 ({CAPS}-5, the primary endpoint), and functional impairment, measured with the Sheehan Disability Scale ({SDS}, the secondary endpoint) were assessed at baseline and at 2 months after the last experimental session. Adverse events and suicidality were tracked throughout the study. {MDMA} was found to induce significant and robust attenuation in {CAPS}-5 score compared with placebo (
                  P
                  {\textless} 0.0001,
                  d
                  = 0.91) and to significantly decrease the {SDS} total score (
                  P
                  = 0.0116,
                  d
                  = 0.43). The mean change in {CAPS}-5 scores in participants completing treatment was −24.4 (s.d. 11.6) in the {MDMA} group and −13.9 (s.d. 11.5) in the placebo group. {MDMA} did not induce adverse events of abuse potential, suicidality or {QT} prolongation. These data indicate that, compared with manualized therapy with inactive placebo, {MDMA}-assisted therapy is highly efficacious in individuals with severe {PTSD}, and treatment is safe and well-tolerated, even in those with comorbidities. We conclude that {MDMA}-assisted therapy represents a potential breakthrough treatment that merits expedited clinical evaluation.},

In the first phase of a three-year demonstration project, 14 instructional staff members, including teaching assistants, faculty, and faculty serving as administrators, were interviewed to determine their informational needs and attitudes toward students with disabilities. Analysis of these narrative interviews reveals that the participants viewed learning disabilities differently from other disabilities and had questions about providing classroom accommodations for students with learning disabilities. This uncertainty stems from preexisting attitudes toward students in general, principles of academic freedom, and questions about the legitimacy of learning disability diagnoses. The study concludes with recommendations for open discussion of faculty and student responsibilities toward teaching and learning on campus.},

  abstract     = {Information about academic, social, and occupational functioning is essential to accommodation decision-making, planning, and monitoring. However, many clinicians who assess college students for {ADHD} focus chiefly on symptom number or severity rather than on the barriers experienced by students in their everyday life activities. The psychological reports and supporting documentation submitted by clinicians to a college disability office were examined for evidence of functional limitations. All students described in the reports were diagnosed with {ADHD} and were receiving accommodations for that condition. Only 32\% of clinicians provided any description of current limitations and only 42\% provided any evidence of previous limitations or history of accommodations. Evidence came largely from student self-reports rather than from the reports of others, medical documentation, or educational records. These findings indicate that the data clinicians provide may be less useful to disability professionals who must select, implement, and monitor the effects of accommodations in an evidence-based manner. Several practical recommendations are offered to clinicians and disability professionals, such as the use of adaptive functioning rating scales, which can facilitate the assessment of functional limitations and the provision of effective accommodations to students with {ADHD}.},

The estimated effects are remarkably similar in the two countries and are robust to many specification changes. Moreover, even moderate symptoms have large negative effects relative to the effects of poor physical health. The probability of treatment increases with income in the U.S., but not in Canada. However, in models of outcomes, interactions between income and {ADHD} scores are statistically insignificant in the U.S. (except for delinquency), while in Canada these interactions indicate that higher income is protective. The U.S. results are consistent with a growing psychological literature that suggests conventional treatments for {ADHD} improve behavior but have inconsistent effects on cognitive performance.},

                  Background
                  Although mental disorders and suicidal thoughts‐behaviors (suicidal thoughts and behaviors) are common among university students, the majority of students with these problems remain untreated. It is unclear what the barriers are to these students seeking treatment.
                  
                  
                  Aims
                  The aim of this study is to examine the barriers to future help‐seeking and the associations of clinical characteristics with these barriers in a cross‐national sample of first‐year college students.
                  
                  
                  Method
                  As part of the World Mental Health International College Student ({WMH}‐{ICS}) initiative, web‐based self‐report surveys were obtained from 13,984 first‐year students in eight countries across the world. Clinical characteristics examined included screens for common mental disorders and reports about suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Multivariate regression models adjusted for socio‐demographic, college‐, and treatment‐related variables were used to examine correlates of help‐seeking intention and barriers to seeking treatment.
                  
                  
                  Results
                  Only 24.6\% of students reported that they would definitely seek treatment if they had a future emotional problem. The most commonly reported reasons not to seek treatment among students who failed to report that they would definitely seek help were the preference to handle the problem alone (56.4\%) and wanting to talk with friends or relatives instead (48.0\%). Preference to handle the problem alone and feeling too embarrassed were also associated with significantly reduced odds of having at least some intention to seek help among students who failed to report that they would definitely seek help. Having 12‐month major depression, alcohol use disorder, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors were also associated with significantly reduced reported odds of the latter outcome.
                  
                  
                  Conclusions
                  The majority of first‐year college students in the {WMH}‐{ICS} surveys report that they would be hesitant to seek help in case of future emotional problems. Attitudinal barriers and not structural barriers were found to be the most important reported reasons for this hesitation. Experimental research is needed to determine whether intention to seek help and, more importantly, actual help‐seeking behavior could be increased with the extent to which intervention strategies need to be tailored to particular student characteristics. Given that the preference to handle problems alone and stigma and appear to be critical, there could be value in determining if internet‐based psychological treatments, which can be accessed privately and are often build as self‐help approaches, would be more acceptable than other types of treatments to student who report hesitation about seeking treatment.},

The authors (a) developed a novel semistructured telephone interview based on the 6-item Adult {ADHD} Self-Report Scale Screener–Telephone Interview With Probes ({ASRS}-{TIPS}) to elicit students’ descriptions of their behavior for each symptom they endorsed, (b) administered standardized tests of executive functioning ({EF}) and academic fluency, and (c) obtained self-reports of grade point averages ({GPAs}), {EF}, cognitive failures, psychopathology, distress, and resilience. Qualitative analysis of the {ASRS}-{TIPS} revealed significant impairment relating to symptoms of {ADHD} in the {PSE} setting. Students reported clinically significant symptoms of {ADHD}, psychological distress, and impairment in {EF} (67\%, severe range) and cognitive failure (62\%, atypical range) in everyday life. By contrast, their {GPAs} and standardized scores of {EF} and academic fluency were in the average range. Standardized scores and {GPAs} did not capture the impairment that participants experienced in their {PSE} settings. The {ASRS}-{TIPS} may provide a useful tool to help document how these students’ symptoms impair functioning in the {PSE} setting.},

                  Specifically, the students’ performance On standardized tests of executive functioning ({EF}) and academic achievement, there was no evidence of impairment. However, impairment in postsecondary education ({PSE}) settings was well described by students in their examples of symptom manifestation in responses to probes on the {ASRS}-{TIPS}. In this sample of college and university students, the reported frequency of {ADHD} symptoms (i.e., "often" or "very often") suggested that the symptoms were quite severe and above the clinical cutoff. Similarly, self-reported psychopathology scores and levels of psychological distress were clinically significant. {ASRS} scores were significantly correlated with measures of psychopathology and psychological distress, indicating that these postsecondary students with {ADHD} were dealing with substantial mental health difficulties alongside problematic {ADHD} symptoms. This high level of co-occurring {ADHD} and other psychiatric symptomatology is consistent with findings for both children and adults (Barkley et al., 2010; Biederman, Newcorn, \& Sprich, 1991). This is an important issue for the implementation of accommodations at the postsecondary level, as accommodations for {ADHD} should be paired with appropriate intervention and treatment for other co-occurring disorders that may interact with {ADHD} symptoms. The study participants also exhibited lower levels of determination and resolve ("grit") toward goals, indicating less resilience in mitigating impairment related to {ADHD} symptoms. Sex differences included higher levels of obsessive-compulsive symptoms, somatization, paranoia, psychoticism, and overall psychological distress reported by females. However, no sex differences were found for {ASRS}-{TIPS} totals, anxiety, depression, or phobia symptoms.

  abstract     = {Background: Despite increasing knowledge of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ({ADHD}) across the lifespan, there is still little research on adults’ own experiences of being diagnosed with {ADHD}. The aim of the present study was to explore and describe patients’ experiences and perceptions of being diagnosed with {ADHD} in adulthood. The study can be seen as an attempt to validate the diagnosis from a patient perspective.
                  
                  Methods: Twenty-one adults diagnosed with {ADHD} were individually interviewed. The interviews were open-ended and exploratory, analyzed using a qualitative phenomenographical approach, and the results were described in categories.
                  
                  Results: Positive experiences were dominant, but there was a complex intra- and inter-individual variation in experiences. Descriptions focused on the diagnosis, identity, and life. The diagnosis was described as explaining a previously inexplicable life history, but it was also questioned, both as a phenomenon and in relation to the individual (the diagnosis in focus). It was experienced as providing self-knowledge and increased value, but could also cause devaluation and concern about identity (identity in focus). It meant help to achieve a better life, but was also perceived to restrict possibilities and cause disappointment over a lack of professional help. It could lead to a wish for an earlier diagnosis that could have spared suffering, as well as a changed view of the participants’ relatives (life in focus). All but one of the interviewees expressed important positive consequences of being diagnosed with {ADHD}. About half of them acknowledged negative aspects of being diagnosed, but none regretted going through the neuropsychiatric evaluation.
                  
                  Conclusions: From a patient perspective, there are major positive consequences of being diagnosed with {ADHD} compared to the undiagnosed situation. Knowledge of the individual’s combination of experiences is important for professionals, as these experiences can affect well-being and interfere with treatment. Negative experiences, in particular, might need to be addressed in the treatment work.},

  abstract     = {Objective: College students with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ({ADHD}) and/or a learning disorder ({LD}) are at higher risk for not attaining a bachelor’s degree. The purpose of this study is to identify the predictors of academic success in college for students with {ADHD} and/or {LD} through a systematic review of the literature. 
                  
                  Method: A search was conducted using Academic Search Premier, Education Full Text, Education Source, Education Resources Information Center, Teacher Reference Center, {PsycINFO}, {PsycArticles}, and Primary Search, as well as relevant journals, following {PRISMA} guidelines. Studies were screened based on the following inclusion criteria: college students with {ADHD} and/or {LD}, student characteristics as predictors, and {GPA} and/or retention as outcomes. 
                  
                  Results: Twenty-one studies were included (20 quantitative studies and 1 randomized controlled trial). Academic regulation, academic self-efficacy, emotional regulation, {ADHD} symptoms, and academic and social integration were found to predict college success.

@article{harrison_accommodation_2022,
  abstract     = {Students with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ({ADHD}) may be entitled to academic accommodations in postsecondary education. Disability Services Offices ({DSOs}) in Canada state that objective evidence of functional impairment is required before providing academic accommodations. This study set out to determine whether postsecondary disability service providers use objective, third-party data when making accommodation decisions. Providers were asked if they would grant extra time accommodations to a fictitious prospective student. The student self-reported attention and academic problems that emerged during {COVID} restrictions, and stated that extra time helped her earn better grades and reduced her anxiety. While her neuropsychological report suggested a superficial similarity to {ADHD} and contained accommodation recommendations, it lacked objective evidence supporting either an {ADHD} diagnosis or functional impairments that would justify extra time accommodations. Despite the lack of current or historical functional impairment, 100\% of {DSO} decision-makers confirmed that they would grant extra time accommodations to this student. Results suggest that {DSOs}’ accommodation decisions are not based on evidence of functional impairment, but rather rely primarily on student self-report and the recommendations of a professional. As such, the current system for determining reasonable accommodations is flawed and inequitable, offering non-impaired individuals access to supports and services that may privilege them over their similarly abled peers. Postsecondary institutions must either develop more defensible methods of disability determination or provide all students with access to accommodations to create a more equitable learning environment.},

Relative to the childhood literature, less is known about {ADHD} in adults, especially college students with {ADHD}. The principle purpose of this review articles is to summarize the major research findings concerning {ADHD} in the college student population with regard to prevalence of symptoms, neuropsychological and psychological functioning. Overall, findings suggest that college students with {ADHD} are at greater risk for academic and psychological difficulties, and they perform similar to non-{ADHD} controls on many neuropsychological tasks.

  abstract     = {Increasing numbers of students with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ({ADHD}) are attending college; however, little empirical information is available concerning the functional impairment experienced by these students. Although preliminary studies suggest that college students with {ADHD} are more likely to experience a variety of psychosocial and academic difficulties compared to their peers without the disorder, findings regarding neuropsychological functioning have been inconsistent, with some studies reporting that college students with {ADHD} perform more poorly on various cognitive and neuropsychological tasks, whereas others report no differences compared to non-{ADHD} peers. The purpose of the present study was to: a) examine the performance of 436 first-year college students with and without {ADHD} (51.6\% female) on measures of executive function ({EF}) and intelligence; and b) investigate the association of self-reported use of stimulant medication with neuropsychological performance in students with {ADHD}. Participant data from their first year of involvement in the Trajectories Related to {ADHD} in College ({TRAC}) project, a longitudinal study following the 4-year outcomes of college students with and without {ADHD}, were analyzed. Participants with {ADHD} performed more poorly on task-based and self-report executive function measures relative to the comparison group. In contrast, no significant group differences in intellectual performance were found. Within the {ADHD} group, receipt of stimulant medication was associated with improved performance on some neuropsychological tasks, but not for intellectual functioning. Additional analyses also revealed significant group differences in {EF} based on clinical diagnostic status. Implications of these findings and suggestions for future research are advanced.},
  annotation   = {Conclusion:
                  
                  Results from the present study revealed that first-year college students, rigorously defined with {ADHD}, compared to those without the disorder, performed more poorly on selected neuropsychological tasks measuring executive functions (e.g., impulsivity, sustained attention; i.e., {CPT}-{II}), and endorsed greater executive dysfunction on the {BRIEF}-A rating scale. Differences were not found, however, with respect to intellectual functioning. Prescription stimulant medication was associated with better performance on behavioral measures of executive function. In addition, an important finding emerged that having one or more comorbid psychiatric diagnoses in addition to an {ADHD} diagnosis was associated with even greater self-reported and performance-based executive dysfunction. 
                  Despite limitations, the study’s thorough clinical consideration and strong methodology (e.g., rigorous inclusion criteria, expert panel review to determine {ADHD} status) attest to the reliability and validity of the findings. The results contribute to the limited knowledge about college students with {ADHD}, specifically how they compare to their non-{ADHD} peers with respect to neuropsychological functioning and the effect of medication on cognitive performance. Future studies are needed to further examine how differences in neuropsychological functioning, specifically executive functions, relate to academic, psychological, and social outcomes among college students with {ADHD}.

  abstract     = {Inhibitory control allows individuals to suppress prepotent responses and resist irrelevant stimuli, and is thought to be a core deficit in Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ({ADHD}). While numerous studies have investigated neural mechanisms underlying inhibitory control deficits in children with {ADHD}, less is known about the underlying mechanisms in young adults with {ADHD}. This study explores the neural correlates of inhibitory control in college students with {ADHD}—a population that, despite comparatively high educational attainment, still shows marked functional impairments in academic, social, and occupational functioning. Participants included 54 college students with {ADHD} and 29 typically developing peers. Specifically, the fronto-centrally located N2 and the centro-parietal P3 event-related potential ({ERP}) components were hypothesized to show decreased amplitudes in the {ADHD} group due to their known association with inhibitory control. Dense-array electroencephalography ({EEG}) data were collected during a Go/{NoGo} task. Results showed lower accuracy rates for the {ADHD} group and significant reductions in P3 amplitude, as well as a trend for reduced N2 amplitude in {NoGo} trials where subjects successfully inhibited a response. Notably, {NoGo} N2 and P3 amplitudes correlated with the number of {ADHD} symptoms; specifically, smaller amplitudes were associated with more symptoms. We conclude that, compared to their typically developing peers, relatively high-functioning adults with {ADHD} still show a deviant neural signature. These results contribute to the growing literature on adult {ADHD} and enhance our understanding of the neural correlates of inhibitory control associated with {ADHD}.},

  abstract     = {Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ({ADHD}) is a developmental disorder, with an onset in childhood, that accompanies the person throughout their life, with prevalence between 3 and 5\% in adults. Recent studies point towards a fourth core symptom of the disorder related to the emotional information processing that would explain the repercussions that {ADHD} has on the social, academic, and professional life of the people affected. This review aims to describe emotion dysregulation features as well as the brain activity associated in adults with {ADHD}. A search of the scientific literature was launched in specialized databases: {PsycInfo}, Medline, Eric, {PsycArticle}, Psicodoc and Scopus, following {PRISMA} guidelines. Twenty-two articles met the inclusion criteria: (a) an {ADHD} clinical diagnosis, (b) participants over 18 years old, (c) emotion regulation measurement, (d) empirical studies, and (c) in English. Due to the heterogeneity of the studies included, they were classified into three sections: measures and features of emotion regulation ({ER}) in people with {ADHD}, neurological and psychophysiological activity related to {ER}, and treatments. The studies found that meet the selection criteria are scarce and very heterogeneous both in aims and in sample features. Adults with {ADHD} show a more frequent use of non-adaptive emotion regulation strategies compared to people without {ADHD} symptoms. Moreover, emotion dysregulation was associated with symptom severity, executive functioning, psychiatric comorbidities, and even with criminal conviction. Different patterns of brain activity were observed when people with and without {ADHD} were compared. These results may suggest that psychopharmacological treatments as well as behavioral therapies could be useful tools for improving emotional difficulties in adult {ADHD}.},

  abstract     = {Objective
                  Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ({ADHD}) is a common condition that often persists into adulthood, although data suggest that the current diagnostic criteria may not represent how the condition presents in adults. We aimed to use qualitative methods to better understand {ADHD} symptomatology in young adults, especially regarding attentional and emotional dysregulation.
                  
                  
                  Methods
                  Nine focus groups involving young adults (aged 18–35 years; N = 43; 84\% female; 86\% {US} and Canada) with diagnoses of {ADHD} were conducted. Participants were asked about their perceptions of the current diagnostic criteria and how their symptoms have presented and changed over time. Data were analyzed using an interpretive phenomenological analysis framework.
                  
                  
                  Results
                  Most participants reported that the diagnostic criteria did not accurately capture their experiences with {ADHD}. They reported struggling with attention dysregulation, including hyperfocusing, and emotional dysregulation, including rejection-sensitive dysphoria. Many participants believed that their changing environments and behavioral adaptations influenced how their symptoms presented into adulthood.
                  
                  
                  Conclusion
                  Current diagnostic criteria for {ADHD} may not capture the range of symptoms present in young adults. More research is needed to characterize attentional and emotional dysregulation in this population.},

  abstract     = {The co-occurrence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ({ADHD}) and problematic Internet use ({PIU}) is associated with increased severity of {PIU} and poorer treatment outcomes. The main objective of this study was to examine the association between {PIU} and adult {ADHD} symptoms and determine whether adult {ADHD} symptoms were a predictor of {PIU} in the general adult population. We also examined the potential mediating role of the dimensional psychopathological factors, including anxiety, depression, impulsivity, and emotion regulation, in this relationship. To achieve these aims, we recruited 532 regular Internet users online from the general adult population. The participants completed an online questionnaire assessing {PIU} (Internet Addiction Test), anxiety and depression symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), adult {ADHD} symptoms (Adult {ADHD} Self-Report Scale-V1.1), emotion regulation (Emotion Regulation Questionnaire), and impulsivity ({UPPS}-P Impulsive Behavior Scale). We conducted a multiple regression analysis to determine the predictors of {PIU} and mediation analyses to identify the psychopathological mediators of the association between adult {ADHD} symptoms and {PIU}. {PIU} was observed in 17.9\% of our sample. A significantly higher proportion of respondents with {PIU} screened positive for adult {ADHD} symptoms compared to respondents without {PIU} (50.5 vs. 21.7\%;
                  p
                  \&lt; 0.001). Individuals with {PIU} reported significantly higher scores than those without {PIU} for anxiety and depressive symptoms, impulsivity, and the emotion regulation strategy of expressive suppression. Additionally, they had significantly lower scores than those without {PIU} on cognitive reappraisal than non-problematic Internet users. In addition to adult {ADHD} symptoms, the multiple regression analysis revealed that {PIU} was also positively predicted by depressive symptoms, positive urgency, lack of perseverance, and expressive suppression, and is negatively predicted by cognitive reappraisal and negative urgency. The mediation analysis showed that lack of perseverance, positive urgency, and depressive and anxiety symptoms were partial mediators of the relationship between adult {ADHD} symptoms and {PIU}. Our results highlight the significant co-occurrence of {PIU} and adult {ADHD} symptoms. This study also provides support for a theoretical model in which impulsivity dimensions, emotion regulation strategies, as well as the tendency to anxiety and depressive symptoms, may play a mediating role in this co-occurrence. In summary, the findings emphasize the need to assess these psychological characteristics in problematic Internet users, as they can be a factor of clinical complexity, as well as the importance of targeting them as part of integrated interventions for both adult {ADHD} symptoms and {PIU}.},
  annotation   = {\#\#\# Purpose of the Study
                  - Investigate the relationship between problematic internet use ({PIU}) and adult {ADHD} symptoms.
                  - Compare psychological factors (anxiety, depression, impulsivity, emotion regulation) between individuals with and without {PIU}.
                  - Examine the predictive roles of these psychological factors in {PIU} severity.
                  - Explore mediating roles of psychological factors on the relationship between adult {ADHD} symptoms and {PIU}.
                  \#\#\# Key Findings
                  - **Higher {ADHD} prevalence in {PIU}:** Individuals with {PIU} were more likely to screen positive for adult {ADHD} symptoms.
                  - **Psychological characteristics of {PIU}:** Those with {PIU} exhibited:
                  - Higher anxiety and depression symptoms.
                  - Greater impulsivity (notably lack of perseverance and premeditation).
                  - Higher expressive suppression and lower cognitive reappraisal (emotion regulation strategies).
                  - **Predictors of {PIU} severity:**
                  - Positive predictors: Adult {ADHD} symptoms, depressive symptoms, positive urgency, lack of perseverance, and expressive suppression.
                  - Negative predictors: Cognitive reappraisal and negative urgency.
                  - **Mediating factors:**
                  - Anxiety, depression, positive urgency, and lack of perseverance partially mediated the relationship between adult {ADHD} symptoms and {PIU} severity.
                  - Emotion regulation strategies (expressive suppression and cognitive reappraisal) did not mediate this relationship.
                  \#\#\# Implications
                  - **Comorbid {ADHD} and {PIU}:** Suggests shared underlying risk factors (e.g., impulsivity, poor emotion regulation, negative affectivity) or potential bi-directional causality.
                  - **Therapeutic focus:** Emphasizes the need for interventions targeting:
                  - Emotional impulsivity.
                  - Anxiety and depressive symptoms.
                  - Dysfunctional coping strategies and emotion regulation.
                  - **Specific risk groups:** Adolescents and young adults with {ADHD} symptoms are particularly vulnerable to problematic behaviors, including {PIU}.
                  \#\#\# Limitations and Recommendations
                  - **Study limitations:**
                  - Cross-sectional design prevents causal conclusions.
                  - Online recruitment and self-reporting may impact sample representativeness and reliability.
                  - Lack of differentiation between types of Internet activities.
                  - Absence of clinical diagnoses or structured interviews for {ADHD}.
                  - **Future research recommendations:**
                  - Longitudinal studies to clarify causality.
                  - Investigation of comorbid psychiatric disorders.
                  - Analysis of specific online activities contributing to {PIU}.
                  - Clinical interventions tailored to impulsivity, emotion dysregulation, and psychiatric comorbidities in clinical populations.
                  \#\#\# Conclusion
                  - High comorbidity between adult {ADHD} symptoms and {PIU} in the general population.
                  - Both disorders share risk factors like impulsivity, emotion regulation difficulties, and mood disorders.
                  - Early prevention and targeted interventions are critical, especially for adolescents and young adults, to mitigate negative outcomes of co-occurring {ADHD} symptoms and {PIU}.

The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of extrinsic motivation on selected aspects of attention in children with {ADHD}, as well as to measure cortical activity and dimensions of motivation as per the self-determination theory. The study included 30 children with {ADHD} and 30 typically developing ({TD}) children aged 9–13 years. Children with {ADHD} exhibited a higher theta/beta power ratio ({TBR}) in the midline and a lower regional cerebral blood oxygenation ({rCBO}\_2) level in prefrontal areas measured using the {HEG} ratio compared to {TD} children. Children with {ADHD} were more likely to undertake activity under the pressure of external stimuli and exhibited attention deficits regarding vigilance, visual search and divided attention. Differences between groups regarding attention decreased in conditions of increased motivation, indicating that motivation can reduce cognitive deficits in children with {ADHD}.},

@article{kofler_working_2020,
  abstract     = {Objective—Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ({ADHD}) has been associated with large magnitude impairments in working memory, whereas short-term memory deficits, when detected, tend to be less pronounced. However, confidence in these findings is limited due to task impurity combined with methodological and statistical limitations of the current evidence base.
                  
                  Method—A well-characterized, clinically-evaluated sample of 172 children ages 8–13 years (M=10.30, {SD}=1.42; 72 girls; 64\% White/non-Hispanic) were administered multiple, counterbalanced working memory tests. Bifactor-(s-1) modeling was used to characterize the presence and magnitude of central executive working memory, phonological short-term memory, and visuospatial short-term memory deficits in pediatric {ADHD}.
                  
                  Results—{ADHD} status was associated with very large magnitude impairments in central executive working memory that are present in most pediatric cases (d=1.63–2.03; 75\%−81\% impaired), and these deficits covaried with {ADHD} inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive symptom severity based on both parent and teacher report. There was also evidence for a unique, albeit significantly smaller, impairment in visuospatial short-term memory (d=0.60; 38\% impaired); however, visuospatial short-term memory abilities did not covary with {ADHD} symptom severity. There was no evidence linking {ADHD} with phonological short-term memory deficits across either the dimensional or categorical analyses.
                  
                  Conclusion—These findings provide strong evidence that {ADHD} is associated with marked central executive working memory deficits that covary with their behavioral symptom presentation across settings. In contrast, visuospatial short-term memory deficits, when present, are likely epiphenomenal, and the most parsimonious conclusion appears to be that phonological short-term memory is intact in pediatric {ADHD}.},

Therefore, individuals’ overall cognitive flexibility and emotional regulation can promote the quality, quantity and speed of decision-making processes, such as adaptable and creative information processing as well as efficiency in setting and prioritizing goals. Moreover, individuals with {ADHD}, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Oppositional Defiant Disorder and individuals with other comorbid states, such as older adults, individuals with Traumatic Brain Injury ({TBI}) can counterbalance their cognitive control deficits through enhancing their problem solving skills. In addition, an advanced research in the bidirectional relation between executive function and problem solving skills could develop a comprehensive methodology for training and assessing self-regulatory processes.},

  abstract     = {Objective: The current study dissociates lower level information-processing abilities (visual registration/encoding, visual-to-phonological conversion, and response output) and examines their contribution to {ADHD}-related phonological working memory ({PHWM}) deficits. Method: Twenty children with {ADHD} and 15 typically developing ({TD}) children completed tasks assessing {PHWM}, visual registration/encoding, visual-to-phonological conversion, and response output. Results: Relative to {TD} children, children with {ADHD} exhibited deficient visual registration/encoding ( d = 0.60), visual-to-phonological conversion ( d = 0.56), and {PHWM} ( d = 0.72) but faster response output ( d = −0.66). Bias-corrected, bootstrapped mediation analyses revealed that visual registration/encoding, but not visual-to-phonological conversion, partially mediated {ADHD}-related {PHWM} impairments. In contrast, faster response output in children with {ADHD} served as a suppressor variable, such that greater {PHWM} deficits were observed in children with {ADHD} after controlling for their faster response output ( d = 0.72 vs. 0.85). Conclusion: Results implicate both lower level (visual registration/encoding) and higher order ({PHWM}) impairments in {ADHD}.

                  Deficits in working memory tasks have been widely documented in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ({ADHD}) studies. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of working memory load in impulsivity during decision-making processes. A delayed discounting ({DD}) paradigm was used, comparing children with {ADHD} and age-matched controls.
                  
                  
                  Method
                  Thirty-two children equally divided between typically developing and {ADHD}, from 8 to 10 years of age were assigned to sessions of a dual-task paradigm. In the primary task the child has to choose between two different amounts of money at different time delays, while in the secondary task the child has to repeat a random series of digits with different lengths. The experiment was conducted in a school setting.
                  
                  
                  Results
                  Compared to peers with typical development, delayed discounting was significantly stronger in children with {ADHD} and discounting rates increased in both groups for heavier memory loads. Furthermore, the memory load impact on frequency of immediate rewards was stronger in children with {ADHD} compared to typically developing children.
                  
                  
                  Discussion
                  Results are discussed in terms of the relation between working memory load and decision-making processes, their impact on impulsive behaviour in {ADHD} and the need for future research to understand possible neurocognitive correlates and use that information to develop better inclusive policies.},

Some argue it can help create a more just society, improve medical care and even avert global catastrophe. Others object that it is morally problematic. Who is right? And what is empathy anyway? Is it a way of feeling with others, or is it simply feeling sorry for them? Is it a form of knowledge? What is its evolutionary origin? In this thorough and clearly-written introduction to the philosophy of empathy Heidi Maibom explores these questions and more, examining the following topics: The nature of empathy and key themes in the literature Empathy as a way of understanding others, particularly 'simulation theory' and 'perspective-taking' Empathy, emotional contagion, and sympathy Empathy's role in moral understanding or motivation Empathy and art appreciation, with examples from film, music and fiction Empathy and mental disorder, such as psychopathy and autism. Including chapter summaries, annotated further reading and a glossary, Empathy is an excellent resource for students of philosophy of mind and psychology, psychology, and cognitive science, as well as for those in related subjects such as art, literature and politics"--},

  abstract  = {Do we humans ever, in any degree, care about others for their sakes and not simply for our own? The empathy- altruism hypothesis offers an affirmative answer to this question. It claims that empathic concern (an other-oriented emotional response elicited by and congruent with the perceived welfare of someone in need) produces altruistic motivation (a motivational state with the ultimate goal of reducing that need). After explicating the hypothesis and the means of empirical test, the authors briefly review research over the past 35 years testing the hypothesis against egoistic alternatives and conclude that the evidence provides quite strong support. Empathy-induced altruistic motivation does seem to be within the human repertoire. They then review theory and research regarding the implications of the empathy-altruism hypothesis, emphasizing that altruism is not always good. It can hurt as well as help at both the individual and societal levels.},

@article{mohamed_basic_2021,
  abstract     = {Background
                  Many clinical studies reported deficits in basic and complex cognitive functions in adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder ({ADHD}). However, the extent in which deficits in basic functions (i.e., processing speed and distractibility) contribute to complex cognitive impairments (i.e., working memory, planning, cognitive flexibility, memory functions) in adults with {ADHD} is not well-studied. So far, literature show only one study, revealing that basic functions explain 27–74\% of executive dysfunctions. Yet, the authors reported that findings could be affected by the selection of neuropsychological tests. The goal of the present research is to replicate such a finding using a different sample and a different set of neuropsychological tests.
                  
                  
                  Methods
                  Forty-eight adult patients with {ADHD} were compared with 48 healthy controls in basic cognitive functions, namely processing speed and distractibility and more complex cognitive functions, namely selective attention, cognitive flexibility, planning, working memory, verbal fluency, and verbal memory. Basic and complex cognitive functions were assessed using the Vigilance and Sustained Attention, Selective Attention, N-Back, Tower of London, Trail Making Test, Word Fluency, and Verbal Learning and Memory.
                  
                  
                  Results and conclusion
                  Logistic regression analyses showed that impairments in complex cognitive functions explained 25\% of the variance in {ADHD} diagnosis. The explained variance dropped from 25\% to 9\% after considering basic functions of processing speed and distractibility. This 64\% reduction highlights the importance of basic functions for impairments in complex functions in patients with {ADHD}.},
