\section{REBT and CT: Cognitive Behavior Approaches}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item REBT and CT were devloped around th esame time, independently of each other.
    \item Therapists with backgrounds from either approach now call themselves cognitive-behavioral therapists.
    \item Both approaches consider mental health problems to stem (at least in part) from maladaptive thinking.
    \item Both address problematic thinking patterns and help clients develop healthier views about themselves, the world, and the future.
    \item \textit{Thoughts, emotions, and behaviors interact} significantly and have reciprocal cause-and-effect relationships.
\end{coloredlist}

\subsection{Albert Ellis' Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT)}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item Originally trained as a psychoanalyst, Ellis developed REBT in the 1950s.
    \item He was frustrated with slow client process.
    \item Noticed that clients appeared to make progress when they \textit{changed how they thought} about themselves and their problems.
    \item Basic Assumption of REBT: People \textbf{contribute to their own psychological problems} and symptoms due to rigid and extreme beliefs they hold.
    \item Clients must learn to fully accept themselves.
\end{coloredlist}

\subsection{Aaron Beck's Cognitive Therapy (CT)}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item Developed by Aaron Beck based on his research.
    \item CT is shown to effectively treat a wide range of mental health disorders.
    \item Posits that the cognitive triad causes the maintenance of depressive symptoms, regardless of initial cause (negative thoughts about oneself, the world, and the future).
