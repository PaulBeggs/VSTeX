% \section{Acetylcholine (ACh)}
%     • First neurotransmitter discovered.
%         • Otto von Loewy -- Discovered ACh in 1921.
%             • This guy took a frog heart and put it in saline. Then, he took simulated the parasympathetic part of the vagus nerve, and saw that the heart slowed down.
%             • He then took the saline and put it in a different frog heart, and saw that the heart slowed down again.
%             • ``Vagusstoff'' (ACh) -- The chemical that was released from the vagus nerve that slowed the heart down.
%             • Cholinergic -- Referring to ACh.
%     • \textbf{\textit{Some} Functions}
%         • \textbf{Function in the ANS:}
%             • Sympathetic
%                 • Spinal nerve leaves the cord and synapses in the paravertebral ganglion (ACh)
%                 • Then makes neuromuscular junction with smooth muscles and glands (NE)
%                     • \cyanit{Neuromusclar Junction} -- The synapse between a motor neuron and a muscle fiber.
%                     • \cyanit{Paravertebral Ganglion} -- A ganglion located next to the spinal cord.
%                     • Except sweat glands (ACh)
%                 • \cyanit{Sympathetic Chain} -- A chain of ganglia that runs parallel to the spinal cord. This is the reason for when you get anxious, ALL of your body gets anxious.
%             • Parasympathetic
%                 • Spinal nerve leaves the cord and synapse in the parasympathetic ganglion (ACh)
%                 • Then makes neuromuscular junction with smooth muscles and glands (ACh)
%             • The only NT in the parasympathetic branch.
%             • NT of the preganglionic sympathetic branch.
%         • \textbf{Function in the Somatic NS}
%             • Excites the neuromusclar junction (ACh)
%             • So, ACh is important for getting motor messages out to all kinds of muscles and glands.
%         • \textbf{Function in the CNS}        
%             • ACh is important in:            
%                 • Learning and alertness (\cyanit{Basal Forebrain})---activates the cortex and facilitates learning.                
%                     • \cyanit{Nucleus Basalis} -- Projects to the cortex
%                     • \cyanit{Medial Septal Nucleus} and \cyanit{Nucleus of Diagonal Band} -- Projects to the hippocampus through the fornix.                
%                 • Memory (\cyanit{medial septal nucleus})---modulate the hippocampus
%                 • REM sleep generation (\cyanit{Pedunculopontine nucleus (PPT)} and \cyanit{Laterodorsal Tegmental Nucleus (LDT)})---projects to the pons and thalamus.
%                 • Reward system.
%     • \textbf{Synthesis and Metabolism}
%     • \textbf{Drugs and Disorders}
% \subsection{ACh Synthesis and Metabolism}
%     • \textbf{Synthesis}
%         • In a nutshell: A breakdown of lipids leads to Choline, which is the precursor for ACh. Acetate is the anion in vinegar (Acetic acid). Then, this is combined with Acetate to make ACh.
%         • In more detail:
%             • CoA attaches to an acetate ion (\cyanit{Acetylcoenzyme A (acetyl-CoA)}).
%             • Then, \cyanit{choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)} transfers the acetate from the acetyl-CoA to the choline molecule.
%             • Mnemonic: \textbf{ChAT}: From right to left: Transfers acetate to choline.
%     • \textbf{Metabolism}
%         • ACh is broken down by the enzyme \cyanit{acetylcholinesterase (AChE)} into acetate and choline. Nice and simple!
%         • The choline is taken back up by active transport and reused, and the acetate is broken down and eliminated.
% \subsection{Two Types of Cholinergic Receptors}
%     • Nicotinic Receptors
%         • Agonist at low doses, but antagonist at high doses.
%         • Iontropic.
%         • Found at the Neuromusclar Function in the PNS.
%         • \cyanit{Curare} (direct antagonist) -- A drug that blocks nicotinic receptors, causing paralysis.
%             • Competitive blocking agent
%             • Paralysis, surgery
%     • Muscarinic Receptors
%         • Comes from a hallucinogenic mushroom (Amanita muscaria).
%             • \textbf{Don't confuse with Serotonin's Mescaline: Cactus; nor Psilocybin: Mushroom.}
%         • Vikings (probably took this drug before raiding) and Koryaks (Nordic people who used this mushroom in religious practices).
%         • Metabotropic receptors.
%         • Predominates in the CNS (although, both types are found in the CNS).
%         • \cyanit{Atropine} (direct antagonist) -- A drug that blocks muscarinic receptors, causing pupil dilation and increased heart rate.
%             • Competitive blocking agent
%             • Belladonna alkaloids (deadly nightshade)
% \section{MORE Drugs and Toxins Affecting ACh}
%     • \cyanit{Botulinum Toxin} -- A waste product of \textit{Clostridium botulinum}, which are bacteria who grows without oxygen.
%         • Interferes with Ca\(^{2+}\) influx channels, preventing the release of ACh.
%         • Because Botox causes paralysis, it can interfere with emotional \textit{expression} because it paralyzes muscles like the orbicularis oculi.
%         • Additionally, since we know that expression influences experience, when we paralyze these muscles, then the emotional \textit{experience} is also negatively affected.
%         • \textbf{Does Botox Decrease Emotional Experiences?}
%             • Population: Women who want wrinkles gone.
%             • One IV: two levels: Botox or restylane (dermal filler).
%             • Method: Everyone had wrinkle reduction. AND, Everyone watches some emotion evoking movies.
%             • Results: Botox group had less emotional experience than the restylane group.
%             • \textbf{Is this a good thing?}
%                 • Another study takes a sample of depressed people and gives them either Botox or a placebo.
%                 • Results: 15
%         • Botox can also be used to treat migraines, cerebral palsy, and hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating).
%     • \cyanit{Black Widow Spider Venom} -- A neurotoxin that causes the release of ACh at the neuromuscular junction, causing continual release of ACh and paralysis.

%                 • Antidote?
%                     • \cyanit{Atropine} -- A drug that blocks muscarinic receptors, preventing the effects of excess ACh.
%                     • \cyanit{Pralidoxime} -- A drug that reactivates AChE, allowing it to break down ACh again.
%         • Reversible
%             • \cyanit{Neostgmine} (\textbf{Prostigmin}) and \cyanit{Physostigmine} (\textbf{Antilirum}) -- Drugs that inhibit AChE, increasing the amount of ACh in the synaptic cleft.
%                 • Doesn't cross the blood-brain barrier, so it only affects the PNS.
%                 • Used to treat \cyanit{myasthenia gravis} (a disease that causes muscle weakness and fatigue).
%                     • Autoimmune disease that attacks nicotinic receptors at the neuromuscular junction.
%             • \cyanit{Donepezil} (\textbf{Aricept}) and \cyanit{rivastigmine} (\textbf{Exelon}) -- These drugs do the same thing as the above drugs, but they cross the blood-brain barrier and are used to treat Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease (only the cognitive part).
% \section{New Drug for Schizophrenia}
%     • We'll talk about dopamine drugs later in this unit.
%     • This new drug now:
%         • \cyanit{Xanomelne and trospium chloride} (\textbf{Cobenfy}) -- A drug that blocks the muscarinic receptors in the CNS, but not in the PNS.
%         • Dopamine but also Ach!
% \section{Catecholamines}
%     • Dopamine (DA)
%     • Norepinephrine (NE)
%     • Epinephrine (Adrenaline)
% \subsection{Dopamine (DA)}
%     • Synthesis and Metabolism
%     • Function
%     • Drugs and Disorders
% \subsubsection{Dopamine Synthesis}
%     • Tyrosine was first discovered from cheese (tyrosine = cheese).
%         • Tyrosine is the precursor for DA, NE, and Epi.
%         • \cyanit{Tyrosine Hydroxylase} -- The rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of catecholamines.
%             • Converts tyrosine to L-DOPA.
%             • L-DOPA is the precursor for DA, NE, and Epi.
%         • L-DOPA is converted to DA by the enzyme \cyanit{DOPA decarboxylase}.
% \subsubsection{Dopamine Metabolism}
%     • DA is broken down by the enzyme \cyanit{Monoamine Oxidase (MAO)} into \cyanit{Dihydroxyphenylacetric acid (DOPAC)}.
%     • Then, \cyanit{Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)} converts DOPAC into \cyanit{Homovanillic acid (HVA)}.
%     • Also, starting from DA, we can use COMT to convert it to 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT), then with MAO, we can convert it to HVA.
% \subsubsection{DA Function}
%     • \textbf{Movement/Motor systems}
%         • \cyanit{Nigrostriatal System} -- Starts in the substantia nigra and ends in the striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen).
%         • Here's the route: We start at the striatum, which then sends an inhibitory GABA signal to the substantia nigra, who sends a reciprocal inhibitory DOPA signal back to the striatum nerve that sends an inhibitory GABA signal to the globus pallidus. Then, the globus pallidus excites the thalamus, who then excites the primary motor cortex, who then excites movement.
%             • Note that if the inhibitory signal to the substantia nigra is limited, then the signal that the striatum sends to the globus pallidus is much stronger, which leads to a weaker signal to the thalamus, and thus to movements.
%         • Parkinson's Disease symptoms:
%             • Weakness,
%             • Tremor at rest,
%             • Muscle rigidity,
%             • Problems with balance,

%                 • 1960's
%                     • Blocks monoamine transporters
%                         • Developed Parkinson's symptoms
%                         • Can't fill vesicles and DA is lowered
%                 • Then, discovered Substantia Nigra was pale.
%             • L-DOPA can be a direct treatment for Parkinson's as well.
%             • \cyanit{MPTP} -- Neurotoxin for DA cells in the Nigrostriatal System (which is not endogenous).
%             • \textbf{History of MPTP -- or why you shouldn't use illicit drugs}
%                 • 1982 -- young California heroin users
%                 • Had used what they THOUGHT was synthetic heroin
%                     • \cyanit{MPPP} -- Opioid analgesic drug
%                         • Not used clinically
%                         • Illegally manufactured for recreational drug use
%                     • INSTEAD it was MPTP (oh no!)
%                         • They instantly developed Parkinson's-like symptoms
%                         • Bad for them, but good for us because we can study it.
%                             • Led to animal model development and possible treatment ideas.
%                 • We don't know why Parkinson's patient's cells are dying, but maybe something similar.
%                 • MPTP is converted to the chemical \cyanit{MPP+} by the enzyme MAO (which is what breaks down DA), which is what damaged the cells.
%                     • Question: Could MAO-I improve Parkinson's?
%                     • Yes!
%                     • \cyanit{Deprenyl}, also called \cyanit{selegiline} (\textbf{Eldepryl}, \textbf{Jumex}) -- A drug that inhibits MAO, can slow down progression of the disease.

%                 • These are toxic to DA cells
%         • \cyanit{Huntington's Chorea} -- A genetic disorder that leads to uncontrolled movements and cognitive decline.
%             • Too little GABA from the Striatum to the Substantia Nigra causes an increase in dopamine back to the Striatum which, in turn, lessens the signal to the Globus Palidus, which increases overall movements.
%             • \cyanit{Tetrabenazine} (\textbf{Xenazine}) -- Drug that inhibits the DA vesicle transporters.
%             • \cyanit{Pallidotomy} -- A surgery that affects the Globus Pallidus to inhibit movement.
%         • \cyanit{Choreoathetotic Movements} -- too much movement

%             • \cyanit{Choreic} (to dance) -- Rapid, purposeless, involvuntary movements
%     • \textbf{Behavioral Arousal and Attention}
%         • Narcolepsy
%             • \cyanit{Methylphenidate} (\textbf{Ritalin}) -- A drug that increases DA and NE in the brain, used to treat ADHD, but can also be used for narcolepsy.

%                 • \cyanit{Orexin} -- Another name for hypocretine; makes you want to eat.
%             • From hypocretine, researchers developed an antagonist for the orexin receptor, which is used to treat insomnia. This drug is called \cyanit{Suvorexant} (\textbf{Belsomra}).
%             • \textbf{Treatment}
%                 • \cyanit{TAK-994} -- OX2R (Orexin-2 receptor) Agonist
%                 • \cyanit{Hcrt-1} -- Intranasal hypocretine-1 (orexin-1) agonist
%                 • Hypocretine Cell Transplant
%                 • Gene Therapy: \textit{introduce} preprohypocretin gene into the brain to make more hypocretine.
%                 • Opiates (exogenous) can increase the number of hypocretin-producing cells in the brain.

%             • From vental tegmental nucleus to limbic system
%                 • Amygdala, hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens.
%                 • Opioids cause the release of dopamine at the nucleus accumbens, which is the pleasure center of the brain.
%         • James Olds \& Peter Milner (1954)
%             • They asked: ``Does electrical stimulation of the reticular formation facilitate learning?''
%             • James Olds visits a conference and listens to Neal Miller, who says electrical stimulation is aversive, so it should be avoided.
%             • One lone rat was put in a box with a lever, and when the rat pressed the lever, it would get a shock to the reticular formation. He ended up pressing the level 700 times per hour.
%         • More studies of this

% Our goal is to take the above information and turn it into a quiz. The quiz can have various formats, including multiple choice, true/false, fill-in-the-blank, and short answer questions. The quiz should be designed to test the reader's understanding of the material presented in the overview and the sections on psychopharmacology, neurotransmitters, and specific drugs and their effects on the nervous system. The quiz should be comprehensive and cover all key concepts discussed in the text.

% We need to cover the following points using the information given:

% ≈10 points on the BOOK information

% ONLY those parts I listed above about amino acids, lipids, nucleosides and soluble gases

 

% To be clear about synthesis and metabolism of the neurotransmitters…YES you need to know the whole names (where I said) and not just their abbreviations of all the precursors, synthetic and metabolic enzymes, and the metabolites).

 

% To be clear about drugs and drug names…there are questions about drugs…sometimes those questions are about drug categories (e.g. benzodiazepines) sometimes more specific…like how does the drug peszkaenzine (Studilify) work?  If the question is a multiple choice question then I will give both generic and trade names in the questions or answer choices, when necessary (it wouldn’t be necessary for things like opium and atropine which don’t have trade names…but of course things like that are still drugs and you should definitely know them because things like this will be on the test).  So knowing either the trade or generic would be sufficient on those MC questions.  BUT I would lean towards learning both the trade and generic names for things in case someone asks you to answer a fill-in-the-blank question…then you would DEFINTELY get partial credit, but not full credit, if you only knew one of the names.  Remember that sometimes I gave you more than one drug of the same category and told you that you only had to know one of them…probably you only wrote down one…that is true…knowing one will allow you to answer any question I ask.   

 

% I think you should try making yourself a Drug Review Sheet…put all the drugs on it from this unit, group them by neurotransmitter or by function, know their name(s), how each works and what each works to do.   Drugs get mixed up in your head if you don’t have them organized in some way.

% Make a LITTLE of the guide, then study it…then take a break.

% Make a little more of your guide, then study it…then take a break.

% Do that maybe 5 times.  This spaced studying will help you to keep them from getting jumbled.
