            \item \cyanit{Differential Permeability} -- The cell membrane is more permeable to some ions than others.
            \begin{coloredlist}
                \item For sodium, the membrane only allows a trickle of \(\text{Na}^{+}\) into the cell.
                \item Conversely, the membrane is more permeable to \(\text{K}^{+}\) and \(\text{CL}^{-}\). (\(\text{K}^{+}\) is the most permeable.)
            \end{coloredlist}
            \item \textbf{Driving Forces}:
            \begin{coloredlist}

        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item \textit{Note:} The above diagram neglects to show that there can be \textit{failed} attempts at an action potential wherein the threshold is not reached. In these cases, the charge of the cell can increase or decrease, but if it does not reach -55 mV, it will quickly settle back to its resting potential of -70 mV.
        \end{coloredlist}
        \item +40 mV (relative to the outside).
        \item Thus, during an action potential, there is a total of 110 mV difference between the inside and outside the cell.

            \begin{coloredlist}
                \item \cyanit{Absolute Refractory Period} -- No amount of stimulation will cause another AP.
                \item \cyanit{Relative Refractory Period} -- A stronger than normal stimulus is required to cause another AP. (This is because of hyperpolarization.)

        \begin{coloredlist}

            \begin{coloredlist}
                \item \textit{Answer:} Because of the refractory period.
            \end{coloredlist}

            \begin{coloredlist}
                \item \textit{Answer:} The frequency of the APs can convey the intensity of the stimulus.
                \item \cyanit{Rate Law} -- Variations in the intensity of a stimulus are represented by variations in the rate of firing.
            \end{coloredlist}
            \item Where does that signal come from that meets the threshold of excitation?

    \textbf{NEW NOTES FOR 03/07/25} \\
    \hrulefill
\end{center}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item \cyanit{All or Nothing Law} -- AP occurs or not once triggered, always the same size.
    \item \cyanit{Active Regeneration} -- The AP is regenerated at each point along the axon.
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item Takes a lot of time (\(<\) 1 - 10 meters/second).
        \item Takes a lot of energy.
    \end{coloredlist}
\end{coloredlist}

\subsection{Conduction of Action Potential in Myelinated Axons}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item \cyanit{Saltatory Conduction} = ``To jump'' -- AP jumps from node to node.
    \begin{coloredlist}
        % \item \textit{NOTE:} The action potential is not actually ``jumping.'' In the mylinated portions, there is decremental conduction, and at the nodes, there is active regeneration with the Na\(^+\) channels.
        \item Decremental conduction in the myelinated portions.
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item No extracellular fluid.
            \item Almost absent Na\(^+\) channels.
        \end{coloredlist}
        \item Active regeneration at Nodes of Ranvier.
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item High density of Na\(^+\) channels.
            \item AP is regenerated.
        \end{coloredlist}
        \item \textbf{Advantages:}
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item Economic
            \begin{coloredlist}
                \item Much less work for the Na\(^+\)/K\(^+\) pump.
            \end{coloredlist}
            \item Speed
            \begin{coloredlist}
                \item in excess of 100 m/s (225 mph) (not as fast as electricty's 300 million m/s).
            \end{coloredlist}
            \item So why not evolve 1 long myelin sheath?
            \begin{coloredlist}
                \item \textit{Answer:} The AP would be too weak from the decremental conduction by the time it reached the end.
            \end{coloredlist}
        \end{coloredlist}
        \item Think of how this applies to multiple sclerosis: The myelin sheath is destroyed, and the AP can no longer jump from node to node. This results in a loss of sensation and motor control.
    \end{coloredlist}
\end{coloredlist}
\section{Conversion from Electrical to Chemical Signals}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item Occurs at the synapse (Greek: ``syn'' = together, ``haptein'' = to clasp).
