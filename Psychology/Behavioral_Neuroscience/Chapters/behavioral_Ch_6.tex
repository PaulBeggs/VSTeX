In these cases, the charge of the cell can increase or decrease, but if it does not reach -55 mV, it will quickly settle back to its resting potential of -70 mV.
        \end{coloredlist}
        \item +40 mV (relative to the outside).

            \begin{coloredlist}
                \item \cyanit{Absolute Refractory Period} -- No amount of stimulation will cause another AP.
                \item \cyanit{Relative Refractory Period} -- A stronger than normal stimulus is required to cause another AP. (This is because of hyperpolarization.)

    \hrulefill
\end{center}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item \cyanit{All or Nothing Law} -- AP occurs or not once triggered, always the same size.
    \item \cyanit{Active Regeneration} -- The AP is regenerated at each point along the axon.
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item Takes a lot of time (\(<\) 1--10 meters/second).
        \item Takes a lot of energy.
    \end{coloredlist}
\end{coloredlist}

\subsection{Conduction of Action Potential in Myelinated Axons}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item \cyanit{Saltatory Conduction} = ``To jump'' -- AP jumps from node to node.
    \begin{coloredlist}
        % \item \textit{NOTE:} The action potential is not actually ``jumping.'' In the mylinated portions, there is decremental conduction, and at the nodes, there is active regeneration with the Na\(^+\) channels.
        \item Decremental conduction in the myelinated portions.
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item No extracellular fluid.
            \item Almost absent Na\(^+\) channels.
        \end{coloredlist}
        \item Active regeneration at Nodes of Ranvier.
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item High density of Na\(^+\) channels.
            \item AP is regenerated.
        \end{coloredlist}
        \item \textbf{Advantages:}
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item Economic
            \begin{coloredlist}
                \item Much less work for the Na\(^+\)/K\(^+\) pump.
            \end{coloredlist}
            \item Speed
            \begin{coloredlist}
                \item in excess of 100 m/s (225 mph) (not as fast as electricty's 300 million m/s).
            \end{coloredlist}
            \item So why not evolve 1 long myelin sheath?
            \begin{coloredlist}
                \item \textit{Answer:} The AP would be too weak from the decremental conduction by the time it reached the end.
            \end{coloredlist}
        \end{coloredlist}
        \item Think of how this applies to multiple sclerosis: The myelin sheath is destroyed, and the AP can no longer jump from node to node. This results in a loss of sensation and motor control.
    \end{coloredlist}
\end{coloredlist}

            \end{coloredlist}
            \item Voltage gated \cyanit{Ca\(^{2+}\) channels} open.
            \item Once the AP arrives at the synapse, the docking proteins release the vesicles and the neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic cleft (this is due to the Ca\(^{2+}\) channels opening).
        \end{coloredlist}
        \item Post-synaptic membrane
        \begin{coloredlist}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item \cyanit{Excitatory Post Synaptic Potentials} (ESPSs)
    \begin{coloredlist}

\subsection{Why Study Sensory Systems in Psychology?}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item Psychologists are interested in? The study of behavior
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Perceptions are the basis for behavior and mental processes.
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item ``Why did you drive through that stop light?'' 
            \item ``Why did you shoot that unarmed man?'' 
            \item The answer to both of these questions are that the person genuinely (sometimes genuinely, other times, they're lying) believed that the light was green, or the person had a gun.
        \end{coloredlist}
        \item And those perceptions don't exactly match to the stimuli.
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item Get a physicist to measure stimulus.
            \item BUT---a psychologist to measure perceptions.
        \end{coloredlist}

    \end{coloredlist}
    \item \cyanit{The Problem of Univariance} -- One cone type can't differentiate between different wavelengths of light. Thus, we need multiple cone types.
