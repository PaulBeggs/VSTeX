      \item \textbf{Short Answer:} What role does electrostatic pressure play in neuronal membrane potential? \\

      \item \textbf{Short Answer:} What is decremental conduction, and why does it occur? \\
            % \textit{Answer:} Decremental conduction is the gradual weakening of a signal as it travels due to resistance and leakage.

      \item \textbf{Short Answer:} Why does the action potential require active regeneration in unmyelinated axons? \\
            % \textit{Answer:} Because it is regenerated at each point along the axon to prevent signal loss.

      \item \textbf{Short Answer:} Why can't myelin sheaths extend indefinitely without nodes? \\
            % \textit{Answer:} Because the decremental conduction would cause the action potential to weaken too much before reaching the end.

      \item \textbf{Short Answer:} Explain multiple sclerosis in terms of saltatory conduction. \\
            % \textit{Answer:} Because saltatory conduction is what neurons that have myelin sheaths use to conduct action potentials, multiple sclerosis, which destroys myelin, disrupts this process.

                  \task Some Ca\(^{2+}\) channels that would normally open remain closed
                  \task More Ca\(^{2+}\) channels open than usual
                  \task Ca\(^{2+}\) is pumped out of the cell more quickly
                  \task Ca\(^{2+}\) channels are replaced with Na\(^{+}\) channels
            \end{tasks}
            % \textit{Answer:} A.
            
      \item \textbf{Short Answer:} Compare and contrast the duration of effects in ionotropic versus metabotropic synapses. \\
            % \textit{Answer:} Ionotropic synapses have fixed, rapid, and short effects, while metabotropic synapses have variable duration that can be very long.
            
      \item \textbf{Fill in the Blank:} In an analogy explaining presynaptic facilitation, instead of 3 APs, the effect would seem like \underline{\hspace{3cm}} APs. \\
            % \textit{Answer:} 4.

\newpage

      \item \textbf{Multiple Choice:} Which of these statements best explains why sensory systems are important in psychology?
            \begin{tasks}[label=(\Alph*), label-width=1.5em, item-indent=1.7em](1)
                  \task Perceptions from sensory systems form the basis for behavior
                  \task Sensory systems are the only way to measure brain activity
                  \task All psychological disorders involve sensory system dysfunction
                  \task Sensory systems are the most complex part of the nervous system
            \end{tasks}
            % \textit{Answer:} A.
            
      \item \textbf{Long Answer:} Describe the complete sequence of events in a metabotropic synapse, from neuromodulator binding to the resetting of the channel. \\
            % \textit{Answer:} The neuromodulator binds to a receptor initiating the process. This activates a G-protein, causing its alpha subunit to bind to adenylate cyclase. Adenylate cyclase converts ATP to cAMP, which activates Protein Kinase A. This causes 2 subunits to dissociate, removing inhibition from the catalytic portion and allowing it to convert ATP to ADP, producing a phosphate group. The process ends when the neuromodulator dissociates, stopping cAMP production. Then phosphodiesterase metabolizes residual cAMP and phosphoprotein phosphatase removes the phosphate and resets the channel.

      \item \textbf{Fill in the Blank:} Background changes your \underline{\hspace{3cm}} perception.
            % \textit{Answer:} Color OR size. (Because a circle surrounded by larger circles will look smaller than the same circle surrounded by smaller circles.)

            % \textit{Answer:} They ``see food words better.''
