\subsection{Nervous System Structure}

\subsubsection{Structural Nervous System}

\cyanit{How are neurons organized into systems? }

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item \textbf{Central Nervous System (CNS)}
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item Brain
        \item Spinal Cord
    \end{coloredlist}
    \item \textbf{Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)}

\end{coloredlist}

\subsubsection{Functional Nervous System}

\cyanit{What are the `jobs' of the nervous system?}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item Somatic Nervous System
    \begin{coloredlist}

            \begin{coloredlist}
                \item Rat studies showed that when a skinny rat has a fecal transplant from a fat rat, the skinny rat becomes fat. This works in reverse too.
                \item Therefore, the microbiota change the \textit{behavior} of the rat.
            \end{coloredlist}
            \item Elevated Plus Maze
            \begin{coloredlist}
                \item A test to measure anxiety in rats.
                \item The rats with the fecal transplant from the anxious rats were more anxious. 
                \item \textbf{This is huge!} This shows that the microbiota can change if a rat is anxious or not!
            \end{coloredlist}

                    \item Also causes atrophy of the fornix. The fornix is a C-shaped bundle of nerve fibers in the brain that acts as the major output tract of the hippocampus.
