\section{Neuroanatomy}

Neuroscience is the study of the nervous system. Behavioral neuroscience is understanding the nervous system's underlying behavior.

\subsection{Nervous System Structure}

\subsubsection{Structural Nervous System}

\cyanit{How are neurons organized into systems?}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item \textbf{Central Nervous System (CNS)}
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item Brain
        \item Spinal Cord
    \end{coloredlist}
    \item \textbf{Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)}

\end{coloredlist}
