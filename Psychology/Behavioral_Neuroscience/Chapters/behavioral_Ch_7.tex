\begin{coloredlist}
    \item The scientific study of the effects of drugs on the nervous system and behavior.
    \item Psychopharmacology is the study of how drugs affect the mind and behavior.
    \begin{coloredlist}

        \item Better understanding of how things normally work.
    \end{coloredlist}
\end{coloredlist}

\subsubsection{Principles of Drug Action}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item \cyanit{Selective Action} -- Drugs are selective in their action on the nervous system.
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item \cyanit{Sites of Action} -- The location at which a drug interacts with the body to produce its effects.
        \item Side effects are often due to the drug acting on sites other than the intended target.
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item Thus, side effects are relative to what our preferred site of action is.
        \end{coloredlist}
        \item \textit{Example}: Opioids primarily affect the opioid receptor system.
    \end{coloredlist}
    \item Drugs don't CREATE effects, they \textit{modulate} ongoing cellular activity.
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item That is, they affect behavior by affecting neural transmission in some way.
        \item \cyanit{Agonist} -- A drug that mimics or enhances the \textbf{effects of a neurotransmitter}.
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item Facilitates post synaptic effects.
            \item \textit{Example}: Morphine mimics endorphins, which are natural painkillers.
        \end{coloredlist}
        \item \cyanit{Antagonist} -- A drug that blocks or inhibits the effects of a neurotransmitter.
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item Inhibits post synaptic effects.
            \item \textit{Example}: Naloxone blocks the effects of opioids, reversing their effects.
        \end{coloredlist}
        \item Agonistic effects can become antagonistic if the drug is taken in excess.
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item \textit{Example}: I make a neuron fire a neurotransmitter, but I also block the reuptake of that neurotransmitter.
        \end{coloredlist}
    \end{coloredlist}
\end{coloredlist}

\subsubsection{Basic Process}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item \cyanit{Precursor} -- A substance from which another substance is formed. AKA, the ingredients used to make a neurotransmitter.
    \item \[
        \text{Precursor} \xrightarrow{\text{Synthetic Enzyme}} \text{NT} \xrightarrow{\text{Metabolic Enzyme}} \text{Inactive Metabolite}
    \]
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item \cyanit{Synthesis} -- The process of creating a neurotransmitter from its precursors.
        \item Sometimes, we break down the precursor to build the neurotransmitter.
        % \item \cyanit{Storage} -- The neurotransmitter is stored in vesicles until it is needed.
        % \item \cyanit{Release} -- The neurotransmitter is released into the synaptic cleft when an action potential arrives at the axon terminal.
        % \item \cyanit{Binding} -- The neurotransmitter binds to receptors on the post-synaptic neuron, causing a change in the neuron's activity.
        % \item \cyanit{Inactivation} -- The neurotransmitter is removed from the synaptic cleft by reuptake or enzymatic degradation.
    \end{coloredlist}

\subsection{ACh Synthesis and Metabolism}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item \textbf{Synthesis}
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item In a nutshell: A breakdown of lipids leads to Choline, which is the precursor for ACh. Acetate is the anion in vinegar (Acetic acid). Then, this is combined with Acetate to make ACh.
        \item In more detail:
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item CoA attaches to an acetate ion (\cyanit{Acetylcoenzyme A (acetyl-CoA)}).
            \item Then, \cyanit{choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)} transfers the acetate from the acetyl-CoA to the choline molecule.
            \item Mnemonic: \textbf{ChAT}: From right to left: Transfers acetate to choline.
        \end{coloredlist}
    \end{coloredlist}
    \item \textbf{Metabolism}
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item ACh is broken down by the enzyme \cyanit{acetylcholinesterase (AChE)} into acetate and choline. Nice and simple!

\subsubsection{DA Function}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item \textbf{Movement/Motor systems}
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item \cyanit{Nigrostriatal System} -- Starts in the substantia nigra and ends in the striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen).
        \item Here's the route: We start at the striatum, which then sends an inhibitory GABA signal to the substantia nigra, who sends a reciprocal inhibitory DOPA signal back to the striatum nerve that sends an inhibitory GABA signal to the globus pallidus. Then, the globus pallidus excites the thalamus, who then excites the primary motor cortex, who then excites movement.
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item Note that if the inhibitory signal to the substantia nigra is limited, then the signal that the striatum sends to the globus pallidus is much stronger, which leads to a weaker signal to the thalamus, and thus to movements.
        \end{coloredlist}
        \item Parkinson's Disease symptoms:
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item Weakness,

    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item Positive symptoms are the presence of abnormal behaviors, while negative symptoms are the diminution or absence of normal behaviors.
        \item Cognitive symptoms are the presence of cognitive deficits.

            \begin{coloredlist}
                \item This could be due to the fact that parents do not think that their children have abnormal behavior until they reach teenage years. With the advent of cameras, we are able to video children when they are younger, and are able to see that people with schizophrenia have abnormal behavior when they are younger.

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item 1950s neuroleptics (antipsychotic drugs) were used to treat schizophrenia. (Old name: major tranquilizers)
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item \cyanit{Chlorpromazine} (\textbf{Thorazine})
        \item \cyanit{Haloperidol} (\textbf{Haldol})
        \item Both of these drugs block post synatpic DA receptors and block the release of DA from presynaptic membrane.
        \item \cyanit{Dopamine Hypothesis} -- The idea that schizophrenia is caused by an overactivity of dopamine in the brain.
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item \textbf{Strengths of DA Hypothesis}
            \begin{coloredlist}
                \item Better antagonists are more effective at treating symptoms.
                \item \cyanit{Amphetamine Psychosis} -- DA Agonists (e.g., amphetamines) can cause positive symptoms in healthy people.
                \begin{coloredlist}
                    \item Agonists include:
                    \begin{coloredlist}
                        \item Cocaine
                        \item Amphetamines
                        \item L-Dopa
                    \end{coloredlist}
                \end{coloredlist}
                \item Neurological symptoms in patients with Schizophrenia like excessive blinking led researchers to further believe that DA was involved in the disorder.
            \end{coloredlist}
            \item \textbf{Post Mortem Studies in HVA}
            \begin{coloredlist}
                \item Given the dopamine hypothesis, we would expect to see an increase in HVA in the brains of people with schizophrenia, but this is not the case.
                \begin{coloredlist}
                    \item \cyanit{The Revised Dopamine Hypothesis} -- Instead of an increase in dopamine, we see an increase in the number of dopamine receptors in the brains of people. However, this was also not true.
                \end{coloredlist}
                \item \cyanit{Modified Dopamine Hypothesis} -- The idea that schizophrenia is caused by an imbalance of dopamine in the brain, rather than an increase or decrease in dopamine levels.
                \begin{coloredlist}
                    \item What you need to know first:
                    \begin{coloredlist}
                        \item Prefrontal neurons inhibit subcortial DA activity.
                        \begin{coloredlist}
                            \item Lesion studies of the DLPFC result in an increase in HVA for mesolimbic areas.
                        \end{coloredlist}
                    \end{coloredlist}
                    \item The hypothesis:
                    \begin{coloredlist}
                        \item Loss of neurons in the brain leads to a decrease of dopamine input in the DLPFC, which leads to hypofrontality.
                        \begin{coloredlist}
                            \item This leads to negative symptoms.
                            \item And an increase in dopamine in the mesolimbic system, which leads to positive symptoms.
                        \end{coloredlist}
                        \item Overview: Too little dopamine in the mesocortial system leads to an increase in dopamine in the mesolimbic system, which leads to positive symptoms.
                    \end{coloredlist}
                \end{coloredlist}
            \end{coloredlist}
        \end{coloredlist}
    \end{coloredlist}
\end{coloredlist}

\subsection{New Drug Treatment}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item From the prior section, we know that Schizophrenia needs
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item An agonist in the mesocortical system (where there is too little dopamine)
        \item An antagonist in the mesolimbic system (where there is too much dopamine)
        \item \textbf{A partial agonist could do this.}
    \end{coloredlist}
\end{coloredlist}

\subsubsection{Atypical Antipsychotics}

\begin{coloredlist}
\begin{multicols}{2}
    \item \cyanit{Clozapine} (\textbf{Clozaril})

    \item \cyanit{Arirpiprazole} (\textbf{Abilify})
    \item \cyanit{Brexpiprazole} (\textbf{Rexulti})
\end{multicols}
    \item These drugs are all used to treat schizophrenia and are partial agonists at the D2 receptor.
    \item An increase in treatment for positive and negative symptoms.
    \item Partial agonists are responsible for a decrease in dopamine in the mesolimbic system, and an increase in dopamine in the mesocortical system.
    \item A decrease in Tardive Dyskinesia
    \item \cyanit{Tardive Dyskinesia} -- Rapid involuntary movements of the tounge, jaw, trunk, or extremities developed in association with the use of neuroleptics (20\% - 30\% of long-term users).
    \item Drugs that impact serotonin receptors: Mescaline (from cactus) and Psilocybin (from mushrooms). 
    \item Also impact serotonin receptors (increase in 1A, decrease in 2A).
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item \cyanit{Dopamine-Serotonin Interaction Hypothesis} --

\subsection{Phencyclidine Theory of Schizophrenia}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item Deficit of Glutamate?
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item People with Schizophrenia have 1/2 as much glutamate in their brains as healthy people.
        \item Then how are DA antagonists helping?
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item Dopamine is a direct antagonistic to glutamate. That is, DA inhibits the release of Glutamate.
            \item Think: Major tranquilizers (antipsychotics) are antagonists of DA, which leads to an increase in glutamate.
        \end{coloredlist}
    \end{coloredlist}
    \item Evidence?
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item \cyanit{PCP (Phencyclidine)} -- Glutmate antagonist that blocks NMDA receptors (a type of glutamate receptor).
        \begin{multicols}{2}
            \begin{coloredlist}
                \item Hallucinations
                \item Depersonalization
                \item Cognitive disorganization
                \item Negative and hostility
                \item Frontal lobe impairments
            \end{coloredlist}
        \end{multicols}
        \item Chronic PCP use leads to a decrease in DA and metabolic activity in the DLPFC.
        \item \cyanit{Ketamine (antagonist)} -- Anesthetic for children and nonhuman animals NOT adults.
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item Causes psychotic reactions in adults (but not children).
        \end{coloredlist}
        \item Treatment possibility?
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item Direct agonists cause seizures and brain damage, so we want to avoid those. 
            \item However, indirect agonists, such as gylcine leads to a decrease in symptomns.
            \item \cyanit{Lumateperone} (\textbf{Caplyta}) -- Though this drug is used to treat schizophrenia, the mechanism of action is not well understood. However, we do know that this drug DOES work on Serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate receptors.
        \end{coloredlist}
    \end{coloredlist}
\end{coloredlist}

\section{Norepinephrine}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item Cell bodies in the pons, medulla, and some in the thalamus.
    \item \cyanit{Locus Coeruleus (LC)} -- The main source of norepinephrine in the brain. It is located in the pons and is involved in arousal, attention, and the sleep-wake cycle.
    \item The plan for this section is to go over:
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item Receptors
        \item Functions
        \item Synthesis and metabolism
        \item Depression
    \end{coloredlist}
\end{coloredlist}

\subsection{Receptors}

\subsubsection{Adrenergic Receptors}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item \cyanit{\(\alpha\) Receptors} (so far only found in the brain) -- Strong affinity for norepinephrine, but epinephrine can also bind to them.
    \item \cyanit{\(\beta\) Receptors} -- Strong affinity for epinephrine, but norepinephrine can also bind to them.
    \item Agonists increase BP
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item \(\alpha\) agonist = vasoconstriction
        \item \(\beta\) agonist = force and rate of cardiac contractions
    \end{coloredlist}
    \item Inversely, \(\beta\)-blockers and \(\alpha\)-blockers decrease BP
\end{coloredlist}
