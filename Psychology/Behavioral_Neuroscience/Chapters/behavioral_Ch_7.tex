    \item Neurotransmitters and Neuromodulators
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item Psychopharmacology

        \item Pain
    \end{coloredlist}
\end{coloredlist}

\subsection{Psychopharmacology in Detail}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item The scientific study of the effects of drugs on the nervous system and behavior.
    \item Psychopharmacology is the study of how drugs affect the mind and behavior.
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item Psychotherapeutic drugs
        \item Better understanding of how things normally work.
    \end{coloredlist}
\end{coloredlist}

\subsubsection{Principles of Drug Action}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item \cyanit{Selective Action} -- Drugs are selective in their action on the nervous system.
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item \cyanit{Sites of Action} -- The location at which a drug interacts with the body to produce its effects.
        \item Side effects are often due to the drug acting on sites other than the intended target.
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item Thus, side effects are relative to what our preferred site of action is.
        \end{coloredlist}
        \item \textit{Example}: Opioids primarily affect the opioid receptor system.
    \end{coloredlist}
    \item Drugs don't CREATE effects, they \textit{modulate} ongoing cellular activity.
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item That is, they affect behavior by affecting neural transmission in some way.
        \item \cyanit{Agonist} -- A drug that mimics or enhances the \textbf{effects of a neurotransmitter}.
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item Facilitates post synaptic effects.
            \item \textit{Example}: Morphine mimics endorphins, which are natural painkillers.
        \end{coloredlist}
        \item \cyanit{Antagonist} -- A drug that blocks or inhibits the effects of a neurotransmitter.
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item Inhibits post synaptic effects.
            \item \textit{Example}: Naloxone blocks the effects of opioids, reversing their effects.
        \end{coloredlist}
        \item Agonistic effects can become antagonistic if the drug is taken in excess.
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item \textit{Example}: I make a neuron fire a neurotransmitter, but I also block the reuptake of that neurotransmitter.
        \end{coloredlist}
    \end{coloredlist}
\end{coloredlist}

\subsubsection{Basic Process}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item \cyanit{Precursor} -- A substance from which another substance is formed. AKA, the ingredients used to make a neurotransmitter.
    \item \[
        \text{Precursor} \xrightarrow{\text{Synthetic Enzyme}} \text{NT} \xrightarrow{\text{Metabolic Enzyme}} \text{Inactive Metabolite}
    \]
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item \cyanit{Synthesis} -- The process of creating a neurotransmitter from its precursors.
        \item Sometimes, we break down the precursor to build the neurotransmitter.
        % \item \cyanit{Storage} -- The neurotransmitter is stored in vesicles until it is needed.
        % \item \cyanit{Release} -- The neurotransmitter is released into the synaptic cleft when an action potential arrives at the axon terminal.
        % \item \cyanit{Binding} -- The neurotransmitter binds to receptors on the post-synaptic neuron, causing a change in the neuron's activity.
        % \item \cyanit{Inactivation} -- The neurotransmitter is removed from the synaptic cleft by reuptake or enzymatic degradation.
    \end{coloredlist}
\end{coloredlist}

\subsection{Other Ways of Agonist and Antagonist}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item Block Ca\(^{2+}\) channels from opening (an.tagonist)
    \item \cyanit{Mimetic} -- Mimics the action of a neurotransmitter.
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item \cyanit{Direct Agonist} -- Binds to the same receptor as the neurotransmitter and mimics its effects.
    \end{coloredlist}
\end{coloredlist}
