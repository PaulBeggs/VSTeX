\subsection{Psychopharmacology in Detail}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item The scientific study of the effects of drugs on the nervous system and behavior.
    \item Psychopharmacology is the study of how drugs affect the mind and behavior.
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item Psychotherapeutic drugs
        \item Better understanding of how things normally work.
    \end{coloredlist}
\end{coloredlist}

\subsubsection{Principles of Drug Action}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item \cyanit{Selective Action} -- Drugs are selective in their action on the nervous system.
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item \cyanit{Sites of Action} -- The location at which a drug interacts with the body to produce its effects.
        \item Side effects are often due to the drug acting on sites other than the intended target.
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item Thus, side effects are relative to what our preferred site of action is.
        \end{coloredlist}
        \item \textit{Example}: Opioids primarily affect the opioid receptor system.
    \end{coloredlist}
    \item Drugs don't CREATE effects, they \textit{modulate} ongoing cellular activity.
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item That is, they affect behavior by affecting neural transmission in some way.
        \item \cyanit{Agonist} -- A drug that mimics or enhances the \textbf{effects of a neurotransmitter}.
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item Facilitates post synaptic effects.
            \item \textit{Example}: Morphine mimics endorphins, which are natural painkillers.
        \end{coloredlist}
        \item \cyanit{Antagonist} -- A drug that blocks or inhibits the effects of a neurotransmitter.
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item Inhibits post synaptic effects.
            \item \textit{Example}: Naloxone blocks the effects of opioids, reversing their effects.
        \end{coloredlist}
        \item Agonistic effects can become antagonistic if the drug is taken in excess.
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item \textit{Example}: I make a neuron fire a neurotransmitter, but I also block the reuptake of that neurotransmitter.
        \end{coloredlist}
    \end{coloredlist}
\end{coloredlist}

\subsubsection{Basic Process}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item \cyanit{Precursor} -- A substance from which another substance is formed. AKA, the ingredients used to make a neurotransmitter.
    \item \[
        \text{Precursor} \xrightarrow{\text{Synthetic Enzyme}} \text{NT} \xrightarrow{\text{Metabolic Enzyme}} \text{Inactive Metabolite}
    \]
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item \cyanit{Synthesis} -- The process of creating a neurotransmitter from its precursors.
        \item Sometimes, we break down the precursor to build the neurotransmitter.
        % \item \cyanit{Storage} -- The neurotransmitter is stored in vesicles until it is needed.
        % \item \cyanit{Release} -- The neurotransmitter is released into the synaptic cleft when an action potential arrives at the axon terminal.
        % \item \cyanit{Binding} -- The neurotransmitter binds to receptors on the post-synaptic neuron, causing a change in the neuron's activity.
        % \item \cyanit{Inactivation} -- The neurotransmitter is removed from the synaptic cleft by reuptake or enzymatic degradation.
    \end{coloredlist}
\end{coloredlist}

\subsection{ACh Synthesis and Metabolism}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item \textbf{Synthesis}
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item In a nutshell: A breakdown of lipids leads to Choline, which is the precursor for ACh. Acetate is the anion in vinegar (Acetic acid). Then, this is combined with Acetate to make ACh.
        \item In more detail:
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item CoA attaches to an acetate ion (\cyanit{Acetylcoenzyme A (acetyl-CoA)}).
            \item Then, \cyanit{choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)} transfers the acetate from the acetyl-CoA to the choline molecule.
            \item Mnemonic: \textbf{ChAT}: From right to left: Transfers acetate to choline.
        \end{coloredlist}
    \end{coloredlist}
    \item \textbf{Metabolism}
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item ACh is broken down by the enzyme \cyanit{acetylcholinesterase (AChE)} into acetate and choline. Nice and simple!
        \item The choline is taken back up by active transport and reused, and the acetate is broken down and eliminated.

        \item Because Botox causes paralysis, it can interfere with emotional \textit{expression} because it paralyzes muscles like the orbicularis oculi.
        \item Additionally, since we know that expression influences experience, when we paralyze these muscles, then the emotional \textit{experience} is also negatively affected.
        \item \textbf{Does Botox Decrease Emotional Experiences?}
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item Population: Women who want wrinkles gone.
            \item One IV: two levels: Botox or restylane (dermal filler).
            \item Method: Everyone had wrinkle reduction. AND, Everyone watches some emotion evoking movies.
            \item Results: Botox group had less emotional experience than the restylane group.
            \item \textbf{Is this a good thing?}
            \begin{coloredlist}
                \item Another study takes a sample of depressed people and gives them either Botox or a placebo.

        \end{coloredlist}
        \item Reversible

            \begin{coloredlist}
                \item Doesn't cross the blood-brain barrier, so it only affects the PNS.

    \item Function
    \item Drugs and Disorders
\end{coloredlist}

\subsubsection{Dopamine Synthesis}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item Tyrosine was first discovered from cheese (tyrosine = cheese).
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item Tyrosine is the precursor for DA, NE, and Epi.
        \item \cyanit{Tyrosine Hydroxylase} -- The rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of catecholamines.
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item Converts tyrosine to L-DOPA.
            \item L-DOPA is the precursor for DA, NE, and Epi.
        \end{coloredlist}
        \item L-DOPA is converted to DA by the enzyme \cyanit{DOPA decarboxylase}.
        % \item DA is converted to NE by the enzyme \cyanit{Dopamine \(\beta\)-hydroxylase (DBH)}.
        % \item NE is converted to Epi by the enzyme \cyanit{Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT)}.
    \end{coloredlist}
\end{coloredlist}

\subsubsection{Dopamine Metabolism}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item DA is broken down by the enzyme \cyanit{Monoamine Oxidase (MAO)} into \cyanit{Dihydroxyphenylacetric acid (DOPAC)}.
    \item Then, \cyanit{Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)} converts DOPAC into \cyanit{Homovanillic acid (HVA)}.
    \item Also, starting from DA, we can use COMT to convert it to 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT), then with MAO, we can convert it to HVA.
\end{coloredlist}

\subsubsection{DA Function}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item \textbf{Movement/Motor systems}
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item \cyanit{Nigrostriatal System} -- Starts in the substantia nigra and ends in the striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen).
        \item Here's the route: We start at the striatum, which then sends an inhibitory GABA signal to the substantia nigra, who sends a reciprocal inhibitory DOPA signal back to the striatum nerve that sends an inhibitory GABA signal to the globus pallidus. Then, the globus pallidus excites the thalamus, who then excites the primary motor cortex, who then excites movement.
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item Note that if the inhibitory signal to the substantia nigra is limited, then the signal that the striatum sends to the globus pallidus is much stronger, which leads to a weaker signal to the thalamus, and thus to movements.
        \end{coloredlist}
        \item Parkinson's Disease symptoms:

                    \begin{coloredlist}
                        \item They instantly developed Parkinson's-like symptoms
                        \item Bad for them, but good for us because we can study it.

                            \item Led to animal model development and possible treatment ideas.

                \item We don't know why Parkinson's patient's cells are dying, but maybe something similar.
                \item MPTP is converted to the chemical \cyanit{MPP+} by the enzyme MAO (which is what breaks down DA), which is what damaged the cells.
                \begin{coloredlist}
                    \item Question: Could MAO-I improve Parkinson's?
                    \item Yes!
                    \item \cyanit{Deprenyl}, also called \cyanit{selegiline} (\textbf{Eldepryl}, \textbf{Jumex}) -- A drug that inhibits MAO, can slow down progression of the disease.

        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item Too little GABA from the Striatum to the Substantia Nigra causes an increase in dopamine back to the Striatum which, in turn, lessens the signal to the Globus Palidus, which increases overall movements.
