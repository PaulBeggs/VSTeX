\section{Overview -- Unit 3}

\end{coloredlist}

\subsection{Psychopharmacology in Detail}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item The scientific study of the effects of drugs on the nervous system and behavior.
    \item Psychopharmacology is the study of how drugs affect the mind and behavior.
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item Psychotherapeutic drugs
        \item Better understanding of how things normally work.
    \end{coloredlist}
\end{coloredlist}

\subsubsection{Principles of Drug Action}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item \cyanit{Selective Action} -- Drugs are selective in their action on the nervous system.
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item \cyanit{Sites of Action} -- The location at which a drug interacts with the body to produce its effects.
        \item Side effects are often due to the drug acting on sites other than the intended target.
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item Thus, side effects are relative to what our preferred site of action is.
        \end{coloredlist}
        \item \textit{Example}: Opioids primarily affect the opioid receptor system.
    \end{coloredlist}
    \item Drugs don't CREATE effects, they \textit{modulate} ongoing cellular activity.
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item That is, they affect behavior by affecting neural transmission in some way.
        \item \cyanit{Agonist} -- A drug that mimics or enhances the \textbf{effects of a neurotransmitter}.
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item Facilitates post synaptic effects.
            \item \textit{Example}: Morphine mimics endorphins, which are natural painkillers.
        \end{coloredlist}
        \item \cyanit{Antagonist} -- A drug that blocks or inhibits the effects of a neurotransmitter.
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item Inhibits post synaptic effects.
            \item \textit{Example}: Naloxone blocks the effects of opioids, reversing their effects.
        \end{coloredlist}
        \item Agonistic effects can become antagonistic if the drug is taken in excess.
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item \textit{Example}: I make a neuron fire a neurotransmitter, but I also block the reuptake of that neurotransmitter.
        \end{coloredlist}
    \end{coloredlist}
\end{coloredlist}

\subsubsection{Basic Process}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item \cyanit{Precursor} -- A substance from which another substance is formed. AKA, the ingredients used to make a neurotransmitter.
    \item \[
        \text{Precursor} \xrightarrow{\text{Synthetic Enzyme}} \text{NT} \xrightarrow{\text{Metabolic Enzyme}} \text{Inactive Metabolite}
    \]
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item \cyanit{Synthesis} -- The process of creating a neurotransmitter from its precursors.
        \item Sometimes, we break down the precursor to build the neurotransmitter.
        % \item \cyanit{Storage} -- The neurotransmitter is stored in vesicles until it is needed.
        % \item \cyanit{Release} -- The neurotransmitter is released into the synaptic cleft when an action potential arrives at the axon terminal.
        % \item \cyanit{Binding} -- The neurotransmitter binds to receptors on the post-synaptic neuron, causing a change in the neuron's activity.
        % \item \cyanit{Inactivation} -- The neurotransmitter is removed from the synaptic cleft by reuptake or enzymatic degradation.
    \end{coloredlist}
\end{coloredlist}

\subsection{Other Ways of Agonist and Antagonist}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item Block Ca\(^{2+}\) channels from opening (antagonist)
    \item \cyanit{Mimetic} -- Mimics the action of a neurotransmitter.
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item \cyanit{Direct Agonist} -- Binds to the same receptor as the neurotransmitter and mimics its effects.
        \item \cyanit{Indirect Agonist} -- Binds to a different site on the receptor and enhances the effects of the neurotransmitter.
    \end{coloredlist}
    \item Blocking agent
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item Competitive
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item \cyanit{Direct Antagonist} -- Binds to the same receptor as the neurotransmitter and blocks its effects.
        \end{coloredlist}
        \item Non-competitive
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item \cyanit{Indirect Antagonist} -- Binds to a different site on the receptor and blocks the effects of the neurotransmitter.
        \end{coloredlist}
        \item \cyanit{Inverse Agonist} -- Binds to the same receptor as the neurotransmitter and produces the opposite effect.
    \end{coloredlist}
    \item \cyanit{Depolarizing} or \cyanit{Desensitizing Agent} -- A drug that causes the AP to stay in a depolarized state; refusing to let the neuron go through another AP, and it stays in the absolute refractory period. (Antagonist)
    \item Interfere with vesicles (leaky or transporter proteins). (Antagonist)
    \item Interfere with docking proteins. (Antagonist)
    \item Selectively deactivate autoreceptors. (Agonist)
    \item Selectively activate autoreceptors. (Antagonist)
