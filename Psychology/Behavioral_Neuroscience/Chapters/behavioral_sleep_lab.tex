\section{What Do We Know About Sleep?}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item Sleep is an active process.
    \item Sleepiness and alertness are controlled in part by a biological clock.
    \item Things can go wrong
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item There are whole books that discuss sleep disorders.
    \end{coloredlist}
    \item \cyanit{Suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)} is the master clock of the body.
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item The SCN is located in the hypothalamus and is responsible for regulating circadian rhythms.
        \item Note the name of the SCN, it is \textit{above} the \textit{chiasm} of the optic nerve.
    \end{coloredlist}
    \item Three kinds of rhythms:
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item \cyanit{Ultradian} rhythms: cycles shorter than 24 hours (e.g., heart rate, respiration).
        \item \cyanit{Circadian} rhythms: cycles of about 24 hours (e.g., sleep-wake cycle, body temperature).
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item Our circadian rhythm is an endogenous clock that is influenced by exogenous factors.
            \item \cyanit{Free-running} is when the circadian rhythm is not influenced by external cues (e.g., light, temperature).
            \item It is about 24.2 hours in humans.
        \end{coloredlist}
        \item \cyanit{Infradian} rhythms: cycles longer than 24 hours (e.g., menstrual cycle, seasonal changes).
    \end{coloredlist}
    \item \cyanit{Zeitgeber} is a stimulus that helps to regulate the biological clock (e.g., light, temperature).
    \item Human clocks run long when left free running. Rats are short.
\end{coloredlist}

\section{What is Sleep?}

\begin{coloredlist}
    \item For regular people, sleep is behaviorally defined as a state of reduced movement, species specific posture, reduced response to stimuli, and reversibility.
    \item For sleep researchers, they take a more physiological definition of sleep.
    \begin{coloredlist}
        \item \cyanit{Polysomnography (PSG)} is a method of recording various physiological signals during sleep, including:
        \begin{coloredlist}
            \item \textbf{Electroencephalography (EEG):} measures electrical activity in the brain.
            \item \textbf{Electromyogram (EMG):} measures muscle activity.
            \item \textbf{Electrooculogram (EOG):} measures eye movements.
            \item Rechtschaffen and Kales (1968) defined sleep stages based on EEG patterns.
            \item In 2007, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) updated the sleep stage criteria.
