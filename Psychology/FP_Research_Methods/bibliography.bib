(Empirical) The participants were made up of Jewish students that went to Sahir college 7 kilometers from the Israel-Gaza border. Researchers interviewed these students at three different points over three different time periods: During the war (January 7th, 2009), 2 months after the war (March 10th, 2009), and 4 months after the war (May 10th, 2009). Results show that PTSD, MDD, and GAD, are at an all-time high during war time. Further results show that after the war (i.e., a ceasefire), relative levels of PTSD, MDD, and GAD, are significantly reduced.

Transition: Building on the study by Neria et al. (2010), which tracked the psychological impact of war trauma on Israeli civilians close to the combat zone, we can pivot to a broader analysis with Ayer et al. (2015). While Neria and colleagues focused on the immediate and residual effects that conflict has upon mental health within a narrow group (i.e., only Jewish college students that lived in the country), Ayer and team expand this exploratory lens to examine the psychological ramifications of both the Jewish and Palestinian population. Their systematic review underscores the pervasive nature of PTSD, highlighting the elevated risk this poses to Palestinians—A group not covered in Neria et al.’s study. Moreover, Ayer sheds light on the nuanced ways in which distress influences intergroup relations, suggesting that the psychological impacts of conflict extend beyond individual suffering to affect communal and cross-communal interactions.

}

(Empirical) This is a study on the effects of PTSD affecting both Israelis and Palestinians due to the conflict. It is found that Palestinians have an elevated risk of psychological distress in part due to the conflict. They also found that Palestinians and Israelis may also be affected in how they interact with those outside of their groups.

Transition: In the systematic review by Ayer et al. (2017), which detailed the psychological impacts of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on both Israelis and Palestinians, including heightened levels of PTSD and psychological distress, particularly among Palestinians, the narrative of mental health challenges within the region is further explored. Ayer and colleagues highlighted how the prolonged conflict has not only escalated psychological distress among individuals directly involved but also influenced intergroup relations, affecting how individuals from both groups interact with others outside their communities. This broader understanding of the conflict's impact sets a critical stage for delving deeper into specific mental health disorders within the Palestinian context.

Marie, SaadAdeen, and Battat (2020) extend this discourse by specifically focusing on anxiety disorders and PTSD among Palestinians, underscoring the severe mental health repercussions stemming from continuous exposure to conflict and violence. Their non-empirical literature review pinpoints the pervasive anxiety and trauma-related symptoms prevalent among Palestinians, largely attributed to the relentless subjugation and acts of violence perpetrated by Israeli forces. This review not only corroborates the findings of Ayer et al. regarding elevated psychological risks among Palestinians but also adds a nuanced understanding of the specific types of anxiety disorders prevalent in the region. By connecting these dots, Marie and colleagues emphasize the urgent need for targeted mental health interventions and further research into therapeutic approaches that can effectively address these deep-seated issues. Thus, while Ayer et al. provide a broad lens on the psychological effects of the conflict, Marie et al. offer a focused analysis on the particular manifestation of anxiety disorders within the Palestinian population, illustrating the dire need for comprehensive mental health support in conflict zones.

}

(Non-Empirical) In this review, they highlight the high rates of anxiety experience by Palestinians due to their constant exposure to violence. This is found to be mostly caused by the subjugation and violence from Israel.

Transition: Marie et al. (2020) document the severe mental health consequences for Palestinians--predominantly anxiety and PTSD--directly linked to sustained exposure to violence and oppression by Israeli forces. This backdrop of psychological trauma provides a critical context for understanding the broader societal impacts of prolonged conflict as explored by Noah Hefetz (2023). Hefetz introduces the concept of "conflict penalty," emphasizing systematic punitive measures by the Israeli government against Palestinians, further elucidating the layers of conflict-driven adversity faced by the Palestinian population. This shift from individual psychological impacts to systemic punitive strategies offers a broader lens through which to view the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, bridging personal anguish with collective penalty.

}

(Empirical) This article goes into the idea of “conflict penalty,” which is the punishing of those perceived as enemies at a higher rate to delegitimize them. This is done primarily done by the Israeli government unto Palestinians.

Transition: From this macroscopic view of governmental strategies by Noah Hefetz (2023), Daniel Bar-Tal (1990) provides a cognitive analysis that illustrates how entrenched misinformation perpetuates these tensions on an individual and group psychological level. Bar-Tal's work highlights the cognitive discrepancies fueled by conflicting narratives, which complicate any attempt at resolving the conflict and achieving constructive discourse. This cognitive dimension adds depth to our understanding of the conflict's resilience and the challenges in bridging ideological divides.

  journal={International Journal of Intercultural Relations},
  volume={14},
  number={1},
  pages={7--29},
  year={1990},
  publisher={Elsevier}
}

(Non-Empirical) In this analysis, Author D. Bar-Tal (1990) examines how misinformation among both groups, Israelis and Palestinians leads to cognitive discrepancy (Bar-Tal & Geva, 1985). Thus, finding a solution to this conflict is much more difficult when both sides have their own accountance of how conflict starts, how it was propagated, and how it continues to this day. This raises the question, is constructive discourse even possible between both sides?

Transition: After considering how misinformation festers from D. Bar-Tal (1990), we can further investigate the question of constructive discourse with a look into Gilovich & Ross's (2016) book on additional barriers that need to be overcame when it comes to negotations between differing parties.

@book{gilovich2016wisest,
  title={The wisest one in the room: How you can benefit from social psychology's most powerful insights},
  author={Gilovich, Thomas and Ross, Lee},
  year={2016},
  publisher={Simon and Schuster}
}

(Non-Empirical) This chapter identifies psychological barriers and biases that hold people back when attempting to negotiate with a differing party. It explores different strategies of negotiating and how these strategies work to combat these psychological barriers.

Transition: Perhaps, if the barriers that are identified in Gilovich et al.'s (2016) research are overcame, is it possible that we could facilitate a conversation between two groups of opposing sides? Yeomans et al. (2020) explore just that: the researchers find that it \textit{is} possible for opposing sides to converse with each other.

  journal={Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes},
  volume={160},
  pages={131--148},
  year={2020},
  publisher={Elsevier}
}

(Empirical) The authors present 5 studies, but the study of importance is the first study. In it, they tested if participants of a given view point, would be willing to converse with someone of an opposing view point. Their results indicated that individuals are able to regulate how receptive they are in a conversation. 

Transition: Hence, we posit that the research conducted by Sunstein and Hastie will foster a willingness to be receptive.

  title={Wiser: Getting beyond groupthink to make groups smarter},
  author={Sunstein, Cass R and Hastie, Reid},
  year={2015},
  publisher={Harvard Business Press}
}

(Non-Empirical) Chapter 4 of Sunstein and Hastie (2015) delves into how power dynamics (especially that of members that are "in") affect the general opinion of others. That is, the act of being in a group, makes you more susceptible to other in-group member's arguments, as compared to out-group members. 

With this article, our goal is to show that if a member of a group is willing to talk with the other side, members of the same group will observe this willingness, and adapt their behavior to be more akin to that of an "in-group" member. pp. 85
