In the first phase of a three-year demonstration project, 14 instructional staff members, including teaching assistants, faculty, and faculty serving as administrators, were interviewed to determine their informational needs and attitudes toward students with disabilities. Analysis of these narrative interviews reveals that the participants viewed learning disabilities differently from other disabilities and had questions about providing classroom accommodations for students with learning disabilities. This uncertainty stems from preexisting attitudes toward students in general, principles of academic freedom, and questions about the legitimacy of learning disability diagnoses. The study concludes with recommendations for open discussion of faculty and student responsibilities toward teaching and learning on campus.},

  abstract     = {Information about academic, social, and occupational functioning is essential to accommodation decision-making, planning, and monitoring. However, many clinicians who assess college students for {ADHD} focus chiefly on symptom number or severity rather than on the barriers experienced by students in their everyday life activities. The psychological reports and supporting documentation submitted by clinicians to a college disability office were examined for evidence of functional limitations. All students described in the reports were diagnosed with {ADHD} and were receiving accommodations for that condition. Only 32\% of clinicians provided any description of current limitations and only 42\% provided any evidence of previous limitations or history of accommodations. Evidence came largely from student self-reports rather than from the reports of others, medical documentation, or educational records. These findings indicate that the data clinicians provide may be less useful to disability professionals who must select, implement, and monitor the effects of accommodations in an evidence-based manner. Several practical recommendations are offered to clinicians and disability professionals, such as the use of adaptive functioning rating scales, which can facilitate the assessment of functional limitations and the provision of effective accommodations to students with {ADHD}.},

  abstract     = {Abstract
                  
  Background
  Although mental disorders and suicidal thoughts-behaviors (suicidal thoughts and behaviors) are common among university students, the majority of students with these problems remain untreated. It is unclear what the barriers are to these students seeking treatment.
                  
                  
  Aims
  The aim of this study is to examine the barriers to future help-seeking and the associations of clinical characteristics with these barriers in a cross-national sample of first-year college students.
                  
                  
  Method
  As part of the World Mental Health International College Student ({WMH}-{ICS}) initiative, web-based self-report surveys were obtained from 13,984 first-year students in eight countries across the world. Clinical characteristics examined included screens for common mental disorders and reports about suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Multivariate regression models adjusted for socio-demographic, college-, and treatment-related variables were used to examine correlates of help-seeking intention and barriers to seeking treatment.
                  
                  
  Results
  Only 24.6\% of students reported that they would definitely seek treatment if they had a future emotional problem. The most commonly reported reasons not to seek treatment among students who failed to report that they would definitely seek help were the preference to handle the problem alone (56.4\%) and wanting to talk with friends or relatives instead (48.0\%). Preference to handle the problem alone and feeling too embarrassed were also associated with significantly reduced odds of having at least some intention to seek help among students who failed to report that they would definitely seek help. Having 12-month major depression, alcohol use disorder, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors were also associated with significantly reduced reported odds of the latter outcome.
                  
                  
  Conclusions
  The majority of first-year college students in the {WMH}-{ICS} surveys report that they would be hesitant to seek help in case of future emotional problems. Attitudinal barriers and not structural barriers were found to be the most important reported reasons for this hesitation. Experimental research is needed to determine whether intention to seek help and, more importantly, actual help-seeking behavior could be increased with the extent to which intervention strategies need to be tailored to particular student characteristics. Given that the preference to handle problems alone and stigma and appear to be critical, there could be value in determining if internet-based psychological treatments, which can be accessed privately and are often build as self-help approaches, would be more acceptable than other types of treatments to student who report hesitation about seeking treatment.},

  abstract     = {To better understand the nature of impairment resulting from attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ({ADHD}) for students in a post-secondary education ({PSE}) setting, the authors analyzed the symptoms and associated impairment of 135 students with a diagnosis of {ADHD} who were recruited via Student Disability Services in Canadian post-secondary institutions. The authors (a) developed a novel semistructured telephone interview based on the 6-item Adult {ADHD} Self-Report Scale Screener–Telephone Interview With Probes ({ASRS}-{TIPS}) to elicit students' descriptions of their behavior for each symptom they endorsed, (b) administered standardized tests of executive functioning ({EF}) and academic fluency, and (c) obtained self-reports of grade point averages ({GPAs}), {EF}, cognitive failures, psychopathology, distress, and resilience. Qualitative analysis of the {ASRS}-{TIPS} revealed significant impairment relating to symptoms of {ADHD} in the {PSE} setting. Students reported clinically significant symptoms of {ADHD}, psychological distress, and impairment in {EF} (67\%, severe range) and cognitive failure (62\%, atypical range) in everyday life. By contrast, their {GPAs} and standardized scores of {EF} and academic fluency were in the average range. Standardized scores and {GPAs} did not capture the impairment that participants experienced in their {PSE} settings. The {ASRS}-{TIPS} may provide a useful tool to help document how these students' symptoms impair functioning in the {PSE} setting.},
  annotation   = {This article not only delves into how {ADHD} effects students, but also describes how other mental disorders compound upon it.
                  
  Specifically, the students' performance On standardized tests of executive functioning ({EF}) and academic achievement, there was no evidence of impairment. However, impairment in postsecondary education ({PSE}) settings was well described by students in their examples of symptom manifestation in responses to probes on the {ASRS}-{TIPS}. In this sample of college and university students, the reported frequency of {ADHD} symptoms (i.e., "often" or "very often") suggested that the symptoms were quite severe and above the clinical cutoff. Similarly, self-reported psychopathology scores and levels of psychological distress were clinically significant. {ASRS} scores were significantly correlated with measures of psychopathology and psychological distress, indicating that these postsecondary students with {ADHD} were dealing with substantial mental health difficulties alongside problematic {ADHD} symptoms. This high level of co-occurring {ADHD} and other psychiatric symptomatology is consistent with findings for both children and adults (Barkley et al., 2010; Biederman, Newcorn, \& Sprich, 1991). This is an important issue for the implementation of accommodations at the postsecondary level, as accommodations for {ADHD} should be paired with appropriate intervention and treatment for other co-occurring disorders that may interact with {ADHD} symptoms. The study participants also exhibited lower levels of determination and resolve ("grit") toward goals, indicating less resilience in mitigating impairment related to {ADHD} symptoms. Sex differences included higher levels of obsessive-compulsive symptoms, somatization, paranoia, psychoticism, and overall psychological distress reported by females. However, no sex differences were found for {ASRS}-{TIPS} totals, anxiety, depression, or phobia symptoms.

  abstract     = {Background: Despite increasing knowledge of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ({ADHD}) across the lifespan, there is still little research on adults' own experiences of being diagnosed with {ADHD}. The aim of the present study was to explore and describe patients' experiences and perceptions of being diagnosed with {ADHD} in adulthood. The study can be seen as an attempt to validate the diagnosis from a patient perspective.
                  
  Methods: Twenty-one adults diagnosed with {ADHD} were individually interviewed. The interviews were open-ended and exploratory, analyzed using a qualitative phenomenographical approach, and the results were described in categories.
                  
  Results: Positive experiences were dominant, but there was a complex intra- and inter-individual variation in experiences. Descriptions focused on the diagnosis, identity, and life. The diagnosis was described as explaining a previously inexplicable life history, but it was also questioned, both as a phenomenon and in relation to the individual (the diagnosis in focus). It was experienced as providing self-knowledge and increased value, but could also cause devaluation and concern about identity (identity in focus). It meant help to achieve a better life, but was also perceived to restrict possibilities and cause disappointment over a lack of professional help. It could lead to a wish for an earlier diagnosis that could have spared suffering, as well as a changed view of the participants' relatives (life in focus). All but one of the interviewees expressed important positive consequences of being diagnosed with {ADHD}. About half of them acknowledged negative aspects of being diagnosed, but none regretted going through the neuropsychiatric evaluation.
                  
  Conclusions: From a patient perspective, there are major positive consequences of being diagnosed with {ADHD} compared to the undiagnosed situation. Knowledge of the individual's combination of experiences is important for professionals, as these experiences can affect well-being and interfere with treatment. Negative experiences, in particular, might need to be addressed in the treatment work.},

  abstract     = {Students with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ({ADHD}) may be entitled to academic accommodations in postsecondary education. Disability Services Offices ({DSOs}) in Canada state that objective evidence of functional impairment is required before providing academic accommodations. This study set out to determine whether postsecondary disability service providers use objective, third-party data when making accommodation decisions. Providers were asked if they would grant extra time accommodations to a fictitious prospective student. The student self-reported attention and academic problems that emerged during {COVID} restrictions, and stated that extra time helped her earn better grades and reduced her anxiety. While her neuropsychological report suggested a superficial similarity to {ADHD} and contained accommodation recommendations, it lacked objective evidence supporting either an {ADHD} diagnosis or functional impairments that would justify extra time accommodations. Despite the lack of current or historical functional impairment, 100\% of {DSO} decision-makers confirmed that they would grant extra time accommodations to this student. Results suggest that {DSOs}' accommodation decisions are not based on evidence of functional impairment, but rather rely primarily on student self-report and the recommendations of a professional. As such, the current system for determining reasonable accommodations is flawed and inequitable, offering non-impaired individuals access to supports and services that may privilege them over their similarly abled peers. Postsecondary institutions must either develop more defensible methods of disability determination or provide all students with access to accommodations to create a more equitable learning environment.},

The principle purpose of this review articles is to summarize the major research findings concerning {ADHD} in the college student population with regard to prevalence of symptoms, neuropsychological and psychological functioning.

  abstract     = {Increasing numbers of students with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ({ADHD}) are attending college; however, little empirical information is available concerning the functional impairment experienced by these students. Although preliminary studies suggest that college students with {ADHD} are more likely to experience a variety of psychosocial and academic difficulties compared to their peers without the disorder, findings regarding neuropsychological functioning have been inconsistent, with some studies reporting that college students with {ADHD} perform more poorly on various cognitive and neuropsychological tasks, whereas others report no differences compared to non-{ADHD} peers. The purpose of the present study was to: a) examine the performance of 436 first-year college students with and without {ADHD} (51.6\% female) on measures of executive function ({EF}) and intelligence; and b) investigate the association of self-reported use of stimulant medication with neuropsychological performance in students with {ADHD}. Participant data from their first year of involvement in the Trajectories Related to {ADHD} in College ({TRAC}) project, a longitudinal study following the 4-year outcomes of college students with and without {ADHD}, were analyzed. Participants with {ADHD} performed more poorly on task-based and self-report executive function measures relative to the comparison group. In contrast, no significant group differences in intellectual performance were found. Within the {ADHD} group, receipt of stimulant medication was associated with improved performance on some neuropsychological tasks, but not for intellectual functioning. Additional analyses also revealed significant group differences in {EF} based on clinical diagnostic status. Implications of these findings and suggestions for future research are advanced.},
  annotation   = {Conclusion:
                  
  Results from the present study revealed that first-year college students, rigorously defined with {ADHD}, compared to those without the disorder, performed more poorly on selected neuropsychological tasks measuring executive functions (e.g., impulsivity, sustained attention; i.e., {CPT}-{II}), and endorsed greater executive dysfunction on the {BRIEF}-A rating scale. Differences were not found, however, with respect to intellectual functioning. Prescription stimulant medication was associated with better performance on behavioral measures of executive function. In addition, an important finding emerged that having one or more comorbid psychiatric diagnoses in addition to an {ADHD} diagnosis was associated with even greater self-reported and performance-based executive dysfunction. 
  Despite limitations, the study's thorough clinical consideration and strong methodology (e.g., rigorous inclusion criteria, expert panel review to determine {ADHD} status) attest to the reliability and validity of the findings. The results contribute to the limited knowledge about college students with {ADHD}, specifically how they compare to their non-{ADHD} peers with respect to neuropsychological functioning and the effect of medication on cognitive performance. Future studies are needed to further examine how differences in neuropsychological functioning, specifically executive functions, relate to academic, psychological, and social outcomes among college students with {ADHD}.

  abstract     = {Inhibitory control allows individuals to suppress prepotent responses and resist irrelevant stimuli, and is thought to be a core deficit in Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ({ADHD}). While numerous studies have investigated neural mechanisms underlying inhibitory control deficits in children with {ADHD}, less is known about the underlying mechanisms in young adults with {ADHD}. This study explores the neural correlates of inhibitory control in college students with {ADHD}—a population that, despite comparatively high educational attainment, still shows marked functional impairments in academic, social, and occupational functioning. Participants included 54 college students with {ADHD} and 29 typically developing peers. Specifically, the fronto-centrally located N2 and the centro-parietal P3 event-related potential ({ERP}) components were hypothesized to show decreased amplitudes in the {ADHD} group due to their known association with inhibitory control. Dense-array electroencephalography ({EEG}) data were collected during a Go/{NoGo} task. Results showed lower accuracy rates for the {ADHD} group and significant reductions in P3 amplitude, as well as a trend for reduced N2 amplitude in {NoGo} trials where subjects successfully inhibited a response. Notably, {NoGo} N2 and P3 amplitudes correlated with the number of {ADHD} symptoms; specifically, smaller amplitudes were associated with more symptoms. We conclude that, compared to their typically developing peers, relatively high-functioning adults with {ADHD} still show a deviant neural signature. These results contribute to the growing literature on adult {ADHD} and enhance our understanding of the neural correlates of inhibitory control associated with {ADHD}.},

  abstract     = {Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ({ADHD}) is a developmental disorder, with an onset in childhood, that accompanies the person throughout their life, with prevalence between 3 and 5\% in adults. Recent studies point towards a fourth core symptom of the disorder related to the emotional information processing that would explain the repercussions that {ADHD} has on the social, academic, and professional life of the people affected. This review aims to describe emotion dysregulation features as well as the brain activity associated in adults with {ADHD}. A search of the scientific literature was launched in specialized databases: {PsycInfo}, Medline, Eric, {PsycArticle}, Psicodoc and Scopus, following {PRISMA} guidelines. Twenty-two articles met the inclusion criteria: (a) an {ADHD} clinical diagnosis, (b) participants over 18 years old, (c) emotion regulation measurement, (d) empirical studies, and (c) in English. Due to the heterogeneity of the studies included, they were classified into three sections: measures and features of emotion regulation ({ER}) in people with {ADHD}, neurological and psychophysiological activity related to {ER}, and treatments. The studies found that meet the selection criteria are scarce and very heterogeneous both in aims and in sample features. Adults with {ADHD} show a more frequent use of non-adaptive emotion regulation strategies compared to people without {ADHD} symptoms. Moreover, emotion dysregulation was associated with symptom severity, executive functioning, psychiatric comorbidities, and even with criminal conviction. Different patterns of brain activity were observed when people with and without {ADHD} were compared. These results may suggest that psychopharmacological treatments as well as behavioral therapies could be useful tools for improving emotional difficulties in adult {ADHD}.},
