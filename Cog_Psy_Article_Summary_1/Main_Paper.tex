% Document class input explanation ________________
% LaTeX files need to start with the document class, so it knows what it's using
% - This file is using the apa7 document class, as it has a lot of the formatting built in
% There are two sets of brackets in LaTeX, for each command (the things that start with the slash \ )
% - The squiggle brackets {} are mandatory for executing the command
% - The square brackets [] are options for that command. There can be more than one set of square brackets for some commands
% Options used in this document (general note - for each of these, if you want to use the other options, swap it out in that spot in the square brackets):
% - stu: this sets the `document mode' as the "student paper" version. Other options are jou (journal), man (manuscript, for journal submission), and doc (a plain document)
% --- The student setting includes things like 'duedate', 'course', and 'professor' on the title page. If these aren't wanted/needed, use the 'man' setting. It also defaults to including the tables and figures at the end of the document. This can be changed by including the 'floatsintext' option, as I have for you. If the instructor wants those at the end, remove that from the square brackets.
% --- The manuscript setting is roughly what you would use to submit to a journal, so uses 'date' instead of 'duedate', and doesn't include the 'course' or 'professor' info. As with 'stu', it defaults to putting the tables and figures at the end rather than in text. The same option will bump those images in text.
% --- Journal ('jou') outputs something similar to a common journal format - double columned text and figurs in place. This can be fun, especially if you are sumbitting this as a writing sample in applications.
% --- Document ('doc') outputs single columned, single spaced text with figures in place. Another option for producing a more polished looking document as a writing sample.
% - 12pt: sets the font size to 12pt. Other options are 10pt or 11pt
% - floatsintext: makes it so tables and figures will appear in text rather than at the end. Unforunately, not having this option set breaks the whole document, and I haven't been able to figure out why. IT's GREAT WHEN THINGS WORK LIKE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO.

\usepackage{csquotes} % One of the things you learn about LaTeX is at some level, it's like magic. The references weren't printing as they should without this line, and the guy who wrote the package included it, so here it is. Because LaTeX reasons.
\usepackage[style=apa,sortcites=true,sorting=nyt,backend=biber]{biblatex}
% biblatex: loads the package that will handle the bibliographic info. Other option is natbib, which allows for more customization
% - style=apa: sets the reference format to use apa (albeit the 6th edition)
\DeclareLanguageMapping{american}{american-apa} % Gotta make sure we're patriotic up in here. Seriously, though, there can be local variants to how citations are handled, this sets it to the American idiosyncrasies 
\addbibresource{bibliography.bib} % This is the companion file to the main one you're writing. It contains all of the bibliographic info for your references. It's a little bit of a pain to get used to, but once you do, it's the best. Especially if you recycle references between papers. You only have to get the pieces in the holes once.`

\subsection{Summary}

In this article by \textcite{miyake2001visuospatial}, the researchers sought to contribute research to the ever growing body of literature regarding the visuospatial working memory (WM) and short-term memory (STM), executive function (EF), perceptual speed (PS), spatial visualization (SV), and spatial relations (SR). They recruited 167 college students, and subjected them to a series of 12 tasks: two for EF, two for visuospatial-WM, two for visuospatial-STM, and a blocks task where participants where to recall the changing sequence of blocks from one color to black. In addition, they ran five tasks that were similar to the changing blocks. \textcite{miyake2001visuospatial} used two \(\chi^2\) statistical tests to evaluate the their findings: the ``Standardized root-mean-square residual (SRMR)'' and ``Bentler's comparative fit index (CFI)'' (Hu and Bentler, \citeyear{hu1998fit} as cited in Miyake et al., \citeyear{miyake2001visuospatial}). They found that the role of executive functioning with STM and WM cannot be differentiated. From this finding, they conclude that ``\dots verbal phonological storage and visuospatial storage puts important constraints on models of WM''~\parencite{miyake2001visuospatial}. For the other dependent variable, differences and similarities between PS, SV, and SR, they found that all three factors varied in how they utilized EF. Moreover, the note SV used the most EF, and PS used the lowest.
