Fetch: This command retrieves updates from a remote repository but does not merge them into your current branch. It allows you to see what changes are available without applying them.

Merge: This command integrates changes from one branch into another. Typically, you would merge a feature branch into the main branch once development is complete.

Pull: This command is a combination of fetch and merge. It retrieves updates from a remote repository and automatically merges them into your current branch. Essentially, it’s how you get the latest changes and incorporate them into your work.

Push: This command uploads your local changes to a remote repository. When you push, you’re sending your commits from your local branch to a branch in the remote repository, making your changes available to others.

Stash: This command temporarily saves changes in your working directory that you aren’t ready to commit yet. It allows you to revert your working directory to a clean state while preserving your changes for later use.

Commit: This command saves your changes to the local repository. Each commit is a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time and includes a message describing the changes made.

Branch: A branch is a separate line of development in your project. It allows you to work on features or fixes without affecting the main codebase until you’re ready to merge them back in.

Rebase: This command allows you to move or combine a sequence of commits to a new base commit. It’s often used to keep a clean project history by linearizing the commit history.

Clone: This command creates a local copy of a remote repository, including all its files, history, and branches. It’s how you start working on an existing project.

Remote: This refers to a version of your repository that is hosted on the internet or another network. Commonly, this is where you push and pull changes.

Checkout: This command switches your working directory to a different branch or commit. It allows you to work on different features or versions of your project.

Diff: This command shows the differences between various versions of files or branches. It’s useful for reviewing changes before committing or merging.
